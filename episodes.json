It works (sort of) and there’s a deadline approaching. No time to write unit tests for everything. No time to write documentation or comments for the next guy who gets stuck maintaining what you wrote. No time to think. No time to breathe. No time!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell… if you take the time to read this article, I promise you’ll find yourself with more time for what’s important.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI used to think that the only way to be a great developer was to work myself sick. My health, friendships, and family all suffered because of it. Understanding the following 5 truths about time management for a developer is what saved me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. You don’t need to learn every new thing in order to stay relevant.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is no question that a good developer should always be learning, but where you focus your learning can make a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to stay on top of your game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“The old thing is dead. Long live the NEW, about-to-be-old thing!”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, don’t get suckered in by headlines on dev blogs that announce a new standard every 37 seconds. Most new technologies, frameworks, and features will never get any real traction and you’ll never need to know them. Those that do emerge will take a lot longer to gain adoption than the blogosphere — and the vendors who hock these new technologies — would have you believe. Companies are invested in their tech stack and, other than a handful of tiny tech startups, they can’t just turn on a dime. So, relax, your career is safe.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFocus your learning on three areas, in the following order of priority:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFundamentals — It’s a lot easier to pick up new skills when you have a real command of the underlying fundamentals. For example, if you understand JavaScript deeply, you can master any new JavaScript framework in record speed. If you understand Object Oriented Programming deeply, you can master new object oriented languages quickly, too. Deeply learning the fundamentals will 10x your learning efficiency. Always focus on improving fundamentals above all else.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe latest version/feature of the stack(s) you use the most — There’s a stack of technologies that you probably use every day. These are the tools that will put food on the table for you and your family. When new versions of these tools are released, it’s worth investing the time to learn about them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn-demand tech that is backed by market leaders — if a big, well established company like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft puts out something new and it starts getting some buzz, it’s worth looking into. There were a hundred and one JavaScript frameworks all vying for attention and then Angular and React showed up and wiped them off the map. I’m not saying there won’t be disruptors that come from nowhere and become the next big thing but, more often than not, no-name tech is just noise.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearning time should be a part of your schedule. Set aside a specific amount of time for learning every day. It doesn’t need to be a lot of time, even 25 minutes of reading and experimentation every day adds up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Writing good code takes less time than writing bad code, BUT it doesn’t feel that way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou probably feel like the time you spend on a new feature ends when you run the code and it appears to work. But that’s just the beginning of your time investment. Time spent on a feature includes time spent debugging that feature later and also time spent refactoring and working other code around any poor design decisions you made when implementing that feature. When you start to understand your time investment this way, it becomes obvious that, in the long run, fewer errors and better design are a worthwhile investment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are two things you can do that will reduce errors in your code and lead to better design.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse test-driven development. Write the test first, then write the code that satisfies the test. This not only leads to less buggy code but also to better design, because when you have to structure code in a testable way, you end up making smaller, simpler functions that have fewer dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse an iterative design approach. Don’t spend time trying to make code perfect before you’ve spent time trying to make the code work. You’ll never, ever get it right completely in your head. You have to get those fingers banging on a keyboard and produce code that runs and does what’s expected. The problem is that developers tend to make one of two common mistakes; either they spend too much time thinking and not enough time actually doing, or they don’t spend enough time improving their first solution. Follow the mantra first stated by Kent Beck: “make it work, make it right, make it fast” — and in that order.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Working 24/7 does NOT make you a hero. Managing expectations does.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is the one that nearly killed me. I used to agree and commit to any crazy timeline my boss or client could come up with. I was afraid of saying “no.” I was afraid of letting anyone down. I would do whatever it took to deliver. I have literally slept under my desk, and pulled multiple caffeine-fueled 40+ hour marathon coding sessions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt first I was a shining star. I would get a big pat on the back and I felt like a hero. But I set an expectation that was impossible to live up to. Working like that is unsustainable. Eventually, I started to burn out, get sick, and miss deadlines. I started getting a reputation as unreliable and inconsistent. It was bad news.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I eventually came to understand, and what you should commit to learning too, is that the real heroes are the ones who are consistently reliable. They say what they’ll do and do what they say. The only way to be that kind of hero is to manage expectations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou need to take control of the timelines so that you are always and without fail delivering high quality work exactly on time. This is incredibly difficult at first. It means having to say “no” and having to push back.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, your boss or client won’t be thrilled by your resistance, but once you demonstrate that you are trustworthy and reliable, everything will start to change.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver time, other developers will be late, deliver sloppy work, or burn out and become unreliable. Then you will become the real hero of your team. In fact, learning this made me one of the most in demand consultants in my market. I’ve built a stellar reputation for quality and timeliness, because I vigorously manage expectations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Not all time spent “improving” code has the same ROI.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpending time is an investment. Like all investments, it’s reasonable to expect a return on investment (ROI). You should be getting back at least as much — and hopefully more — value than you put in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe talked about “make it work, make it right, make it fast.” It’s a good mantra but there is a trap: “right” does not mean perfect, and “fast” does not mean absolutely as fast as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Right” means that the code works consistently and is easy to refactor. “Fast” means that the speed of execution does not have a negative impact on the overall user experience. The most important thing is that your application feels fast to the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, don’t waste time trying to shave time off a function that is barely used, or trying to save another few milliseconds on something that already runs faster than a human can blink (~300ms). And don’t waste time trying to refactor working, well-structured code because you just learned some new technique or approach that you’ve convinced yourself you suddenly have to go back and apply to everything you’ve ever done.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Scheduled down time makes you more productive.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis was a very hard one for me to learn and accept. How can you possibly be more productive when you’re not spending all your time producing? Well, it’s true.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to Allison Gabriel, an assistant professor of management at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies job demands and employee motivation, “There is a lot of research that says we have a limited pool of cognitive resources. When you are constantly draining your resources, you are not being as productive as you can be. If you get depleted, we see performance decline. You’re able to persist less and have trouble solving tasks”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlways working sets off strain reactions, such as stress, fatigue, and negative mood. These drain your focus and your physical and emotional resources.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe brain’s ability to self-regulate — to stay disciplined — wanes with each exercise of self-control during the day. It’s a loss of resources that must be replenished. Otherwise it becomes harder to stay on-task, be attentive and solve problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour mind and body need down time, and they’re going to get it whether you like it or not. So, schedule that down time. Actually plan and put on your calendar real scheduled breaks. This will allow you to take down time without feeling guilty about it. It will make work-time easier to endure because you’ll know that you have a scheduled break right around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMore help and resources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you even more, I’ve put together a list of free and useful resources (videos, tutorials and websites) that can help you better understand and implement the insights I’ve just shared with you.

It took me about two weeks to realize I absolutely hated it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was working 6 days a week, waking up at 3:30am in order to be at the hospital by 5:30. Making next to nothing, I quickly racked up $10,000 in credit card debt. I knew I deserved more, but I had no idea how to get it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw people in my graduating class living in New York or San Francisco, making six figure salaries and going on exotic trips. I often wondered what they had figured out that I hadn’t. What was their secret?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI dedicated the next 12 months of my life to finding the answer. In this article I’m going to share everything I learned along the way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, I’ll walk you through the exact process you can use to get a job interview at your dream company even if you don’t know a single person there — you won’t even need to apply online.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, I’ll teach you how to ace the interview process, get the offer, and land a salary you deserve.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI personally used these exact strategies to get interviews and offers at companies like Google, Uber and Twitter. They are also the same tactics that my students have used to land interviews and offers at Google, Microsoft, Slack, Deloitte, PWC, American Express, ESPN and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReferrals Are The Most Effective Way To Get Hired\u003cbr /\u003e A recent LinkedIn survey on talent trends showed that 1 in 3 people were actively looking for new work. As of January 2017, the population of employed people in the United States was 123 million. This means that, at any given time, 41 million people are looking for work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn average, an open role at a well known company gets ~250 resumes. 75% of these resumes came from some sort of online portal (like the company’s online application, or a career aggregator site like Indeed.com).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce submitted, these applications are screened by Applicant Tracking software that scans them for keywords. At the end of the process, ~5 resumes make it into the hands of a recruiter. That’s 2% at best.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdditionally, The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that 80% of jobs aren’t advertised online.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat means that 75% of people applying for jobs are all competing for 20% of the opportunities!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOops.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to getting hired, referrals are the most effective way to secure an interview and land the offer.

However, before you hit “Search,” we need to remember that you are looking for someone who can influence the hiring process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, I usually use a title that is one level up from the position that I’m looking for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re not familiar with title hierarchy structures in the corporate world, here is a quick guide (if you are already familiar with how titles are structured, feel free to skip this section):\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSide Note: A Brief Guide To Company Organizational Structures By Title\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery company has a hierarchy starting at the top with the CEO/Founder all the way down to the entry level employees. When researching companies, especially people to speak to within those companies, it helps to know where certain titles fit in the food chain. That way you can ensure you are talking to the right person.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is a general list of titles that fits almost any company, starting at the top:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eC-­Level (CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, etc.)\u003cbr /\u003e Vice President (VP)\u003cbr /\u003e Director\u003cbr /\u003e Senior Manager\u003cbr /\u003e Manager\u003cbr /\u003e Coordinator (Entry Level)\u003cbr /\u003e Associates, Executives, and Seniors\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn many companies, the above titles have some sort of variation that allows for greater segmentation within that level. The most common forms of this are Associate, Executive, and Senior. Here is what those mean:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAssociate: this title is usually given to someone who is halfway between positions for some reason (maybe there is typically a 4 year gap between levels and they are 2 years in). A person with Associate in their title is usually one notch below a person with the original title.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, an Associate Account Manager would most likely be one level below an Account Manager.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSenior: ­this title is the more experienced version of an Associate. People with Senior in their title are usually one notch above the original title. For example, a Senior Account Manager would be one notch above an Account Manager.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eExecutive: ­this title is usually given to people who are very senior, or around the level of Vice President. The two most common cases are\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSales Executive/Account Executive (synonymous terms for a senior salesperson) or Executive Vice President who is two notches above a Vice\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePresident and one notch above a Senior Vice President. That should be all the info you need to make an educated decision around where people stand within the company you are researching.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you’re familiar with the company structure, let’s get back to finding that influencer who can help you land this job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince we are looking for an Account Manager role, the next step up would be Senior Account Manager so your LinkedIn search would look like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur first result? A Senior Account Manager who works in B2B at Google:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eObtaining Contact Info\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow we’re going to reach out and set up a meeting. It’s best to do these in person but over the phone can work well if you’re dream job is in another state or country.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to get in touch with our influencer, we’re going to need their contact info. Here are 3 strategies you can use to find almost anyone’s corporate email address:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis one is obvious but it’s a big time saver and definitely worth the 10 seconds it takes to check.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the person’s profile, right under their picture, there can be a button labeled “Contact Info” (I say “can be” because people have the option to remove it). Occasionally, people will have their email address listed right there — voila!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf not, let’s move right along…\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReverse Lookup\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHead over to Voila Norbert and enter the first and last name of the person you are searching for, as well as their company’s website. For example, if we were trying to find Larry Page’s email, our form would look like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce it spits out their email you can confirm it using MailTester.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMatching Formats\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf that doesn’t work, you can try finding someone else’s email at the company and use that format reverse engineering your target email address.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, using Larry Page again, if I know that my buddy John Smith’s email is john at google.com then I can assume that Larry’s email is larry at google.com.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe easiest way to get a hold of a company email address is to reach out to someone in sales or media because both of these departments usually have inbound lead forms and people on the other end ready to pounce on those leads.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe can also use our LinkedIn method here and target salespeople.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSalespeople almost always have their corporate email listed on their LinkedIn because it’s a free win for them. If someone is looking for their product and then finds them on LinkedIn, boom — they just got an effortless inbound lead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have the format, you can use MailTester to confirm your target email address.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eResearch, Research, Research\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you have your potential influencer, it’s time to do some research so you can effectively reach out and build that relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStart with the usual suspects — LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and look for common points of interest. To be honest, most people are better at this online research thing than I am, so I’ll get back to the meat here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne thing I will say is, don’t skimp. The more you get to know this person beforehand, the better your chances of landing a referral from them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome people have said to me, “Austin, isn’t this a little weird? I feel like I’m kind of stalking this person.” I totally get it. However, this information is critical for quickly building a strong relationship and getting that referral.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlso, in my experience, people tend to expect that you’ve done some research on them. The key is to understand what is kosher to bring up out of the blue and what isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePeople are OK with you checking out their LinkedIn, but they may be a little weirded out if you mention that picture from Saturday’s Bar Crawl you saw on Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy general rule of thumb is this: if it exists on LinkedIn, it’s fair game to bring up. If you found it somewhere else (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) use a different method. For example, if I see that my influencer is a skiing fanatic, I may bring up that I went on a ski trip a few weeks beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSending The Email\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you have your potential influencer and their contact info, it’s time to reach out. Not only is this one of the scarier parts of this process, it is also the most pivotal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you get past that hump, I’ve included the exact email script that I used to reach out to people. In this case, I’m reaching out to\u003cbr /\u003e Tim who works at Google:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSubject: Quick Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi Tim,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy name is Austin and I currently work at Cultivated Culture. I was browsing through LinkedIn and came across your information — I hope you don’t mind me reaching out of the blue here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw that you have extensive experience in Google’s Technology B2B vertical and I’m very interested in learning more about that space. I would love to have the opportunity to run some questions by you, as well as tap into any advice you may have given your knowledge of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI know that your time is extremely valuable so please don’t feel to need to respond in depth. If you do have 5 minutes to chat, I would really appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a few key points to the email above:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAddress the person you are emailing by name\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eState who you are and make it personable\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInclude some flattery that positions the person as an “expert”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs for the subject, Fast Company did a study where they emailed 1,000 C-level executives from Fortune \u0026 Inc 500 companies. They found that the subject line “Quick Question” made up 66.7% of total replies. I saw similar results.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll of that said, this script is just a framework. You will most likely need to tweak your emails to fit the situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen that time comes, I recommend checking out Sam Parr’s incredible guide on how to cold email like a boss (Sam has started conversations with Jeff Bezos and Brian Lee (aka Jessica Alba’s Honest co-founder) via cold email). It’s the same guide I used to help craft my email templates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow hit Send!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePrepare For Your Meeting\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to prepare, we have to know what we’re preparing for. The goal of your meeting is to position your influencer as an expert, make them feel special, and build a relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou should not and will not mention anything about the opening at their company. People innately enjoy helping others and if you follow the steps above, they will bring this up naturally.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou will want to prepare a list of questions that gets them to open up about themselves and the company. I like to ask them several softballs to get things warmed up and then hit them with a few questions they are guaranteed to remember.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is a quick set that I’ve had success with in the past (I’ve found the last one really seems to stick):\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw you worked at [Previous Companies]. How did you end up going from [First Industry] to becoming interested in [Current Company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou hear a lot about [Current Company] in the news, but I’d love to hear more about why you love working there. What’s your favorite part?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is one totally unexpected lesson you’ve learned from working at [Current Company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe “Million Dollar” Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRegardless of the questions you choose, there is one that you must always be sure to ask:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“What is the biggest challenge your team is facing right now?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReally dig in here, get them to be specific. This information is going to be critical in helping you land a referral from this person, as well as getting the offer farther down the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour Homework: Adding Value (In A Big Way)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOkay, so you met with your influencer, things went great, and you identified a major pain point that the team is having. Now we’re going to focus on that last piece.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver the next week you are going to research the crap out of your influencer’s problem. Then you are going to come up with a solution and draft up a proposal for how you would solve it. Your proposal should include:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA summary of the problem (to illustrate that you understand their pain)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA step-by-step framework of how you would solve this problem\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA brief outline of how your skill set positions you as an asset to implement that solution\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTruthfully, this process deserves a post of its own but this should give you a good idea of what you need to do. If you’re the type of person that likes concrete examples, check out this guerrilla usability test that Raghav Haran ran for Airbnb.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have all of this information, consolidate it into a Word document, head over to Upwork, and hire a graphic designer to make your proposal look amazing. If you’ve never hired on Upwork before, here is an amazing guide by Dave Nevogt on how to do it right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFollowing Up With Your Proposal\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow we’re going to reach back out to our influencer with the proposal. Here’s the template I used:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Influencer],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThanks again for taking the time out to chat last week.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent a lot of time thinking about what you said regarding [team’s biggest challenge]. In fact, I created a short framework that should help you solve it. Please find that attached.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you have some time, I would love to chat about it in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlease let me know if you have any questions, I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s very important that you do not mention the open position in any of your emails or the proposal. Be patient and wait for their response. When they do get back to you, they will not only bring up the opening but they will ask you if you’re interested.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKindly accept and play it cool. You’re in!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePart 2: How To Breeze Through The Interview Process\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFast forward — our influencer passed along our resume to HR and they have reached out to set up a phone screen. Once we get past that, we’ll be on to interviewing with the team, and then getting the job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA note to developers: The advice below does not cover technical interviews, which are typically required for developer/software roles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, the advice below will help create more time to prepare for technical interviews by minimizing the amount of preparation needed for other parts of the interview process. If you are applying for a development role, I suggest you read Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInterviews can be daunting, especially at companies like Google, Amazon, or Uber. I’m sure you’ve read the horror stories about crazy questions they ask people like “Quick — How many golf balls can fit inside a school bus,” or, “how many gas stations are there in Manhattan?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe truth is, most of these companies have done away with those questions. They crunched the numbers and found that the answers didn’t correlate with high employee performance (shocker, I know). In fact, Google’s own Senior Vice President of People Operations called them a “complete waste of time.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese companies have since reverted back to the standard style of interviews, which is great for us because it makes it much easier to identify patterns. We can essentially “guess” what questions will be on the test and prepare answers that will blow our interviewers away (it works way better than it did in college, I swear).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is the process I used to prepare for each one.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNailing The Basics: Questions You’ll Get In Every Interview\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to renowned career guru Penelope Trunk, one of the easiest ways to be a better interviewer is to prepare for the most obvious questions. You may be saying “well duh,” but you’d be surprised by how many people spread themselves too thin by trying to prepare answers to every possible question.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e99% of the interviews you go on will follow the exact same template. If you can master the format, your confidence will skyrocket and you’ll be prepared for almost any situation you get thrown into.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Universal Job Interview Format:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about yourself (your experience, why you are interested in this role, etc.)\u003cbr /\u003e A mix of behavioral questions, which we’ll dive into shortly\u003cbr /\u003e What questions do you have for me (the interviewer)?\u003cbr /\u003e Let’s tackle each individually.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell Me About Yourself\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is your first impression. More importantly, it’s the only part of the interview that you totally control. Do NOT rattle off your resume like a grocery list.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to nail this part you need to craft an interesting story — your story. You want it to be concise (around 2–3 minutes) and you need to think about what you want to convey. I recommend:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eChoosing 2–3 themes to build your story around (for me, those themes were Persistence, Agility, and Success)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIncluding quantitative metrics whenever possible\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAddressing the question of why you want to leave your current position (they are going to ask you this anyways, addressing it early shows that you’re aware it’s a concern of theirs and helps put them at ease)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help get you started, here is what my story looked like. To give you some context, I was a biology major who was interested in landing a job in digital marketing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGrowing up, like most people, I wanted to be a doctor. I went to [college] where I majored in biology and planned my course to medical school. Not long after, I decided that pre-med wasn’t for me. I wanted to get into digital marketing, and I wanted to be in New York. I set my sights on this goal and created a plan that would get me there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 2013, I graduated with my biology degree and took a job in medical device sales where I worked from 5:30am — 12:30pm covering surgical cases in the operating room. Then, every day, I would come home and study digital marketing until 8:00pm. In order to gain relevant experience, I got certified in Google Analytics \u0026 AdWords and created my own consulting firm that focused on using search engine marketing to generate leads for private golf communities. We were able to increase home sales by an average of 20% while reducing the cost per lead by around 10%. Armed with my new credentials, I began to look for positions in New York.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEventually, I was offered a position at my current company (a promotional analytics company in New York). During my tenure there I have grown my book of business by 467%, spearheaded the creation of an internal group dedicated to marketing the company on the internet, and helped close the second largest deal in company history.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, the company has restructured several times since I was brought on. I’ve had 3 different managers over the past year, as well as 3 titles with different sets of responsibilities. I’m looking for something a bit more stable and [company I am interviewing at] has been somewhere that I have wanted to work since I got into this industry. I’m really excited to have this opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePro Tip: You are telling a story. Don’t be afraid to embellish a bit. I’m not saying you should lie or make up stories, but you want to sell yourself and you can bet your butt that your competition isn’t afraid to inflate their credentials.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBehavioral Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext up is the dreaded set of behavioral questions. The ones meant to tease out your thought process and your ability to be a “team player.” This is the part where our educated “guesses” are going to come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe behavioral section is broken down into two parts that I call Standard Questions and Company Specific Questions. Let’s start with the former.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStandard Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou are going to be asked a variation of one, if not all, of these questions in every single interview you go to:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy do you want to work for us?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you exhibited leadership\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time where you had to work as a team\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you’ve had to work with a difficult person, or difficult people\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you failed\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you overcame an obstacle\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time when you had success\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you can answer these 6 questions, you can handle 9 out of 10 interviews with no other preparation and be totally fine. Just follow the same set of rules I mentioned above in the Tell Me About Yourself section:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCraft a concise story\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake sure to include quantitative metrics that illustrate your success\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnticipate and address objections\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCompany Specific Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are questions that fall in the middle of the 7 listed above and “why are man hole covers round?” Never fear though, we can anticipate these too.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHead over to GlassDoor. If you’ve never heard of GlassDoor, it’s a great resource for any job seeker that includes salaries, reviews, and interview information for almost any company in the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, you are going to search for the position you’re applying for. In keeping with our theme, we’ll search for “Google” under Companies \u0026 Reviews:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, we’re going to click on the “Interviews” Tab:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen scroll down and click on “Filter Interviews” which will bring up some advanced settings. Here we’ll type in the title of the job we want (Account Manager, in this case) and the location (New York, NY). We’ll also select “Received Offer” because the people who didn’t receive offers tend to be slightly, ahem, biased:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis will pull up a list of reviews from everyone who interviewed and received an offer for that position. The general comments are really helpful, but we want to focus on a section called Interview Questions towards the bottom. I usually comb through 10–15 of these and add all of the interview questions into a Word doc so I can answer them later:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow you have your second set of questions to prepare for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat Questions Do You Have For Me?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, once they are done peppering you with questions, your interviewer will ask if you have any questions for them. This is the most crucial part of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy? Because so many people neglect it. If you can ask some questions that are even slightly outside of the box, I’ve found that really sticks with the interviewer more than any other part of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter every interview I’ve been on, I asked for feedback. Without fail, the interviewer made a positive comment about the questions I asked. The good news for you is that I asked the same exact questions in every single one. Here they are:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is your favorite part about working here?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say that, in one year, you are looking back on this hire. What has that person done to exceed expectations on every level?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAsk about a current event (for example — I saw that [Competitor X] came out with this product. How do you see that affecting your business?)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is the most unexpected lesson you’ve learned while working at [company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me a little bit more about you, what do you like to do outside of work?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese questions work because they are based on specific principles of behavioral psychology. They break down barriers and help build a positive association in your interviewer’s mind. If you’re interested in the details, you can read more about it here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSay Thank You\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile we’re on the subject, be absolutely sure to send a thank you note to everyone you interviewed with. Also include a personal touch to each one (something that you gained from that last question).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany people I talk to say “but I don’t have their email.” Ask for it! At the end of every interview always, always ask for a business card or write down the person’s email in your notebook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you forget, try using the techniques I outlined above for finding people’s emails and you should be fine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePart 3 — Following Up \u0026 What To Do If They Say No\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is one of the most common mistakes I see from job applicants. I understand how nerve wracking it is to sit there and wait while everything is completely out of your hands.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the toughest things I had to learn throughout my interview process was that, while this is a HUGE deal to you, it’s really just another agenda item on the hiring manager’s schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey will get back to you, and if they don’t? You don’t want to work for someone who doesn’t have the courtesy of replying to the people they do business with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen Can I Send Them A Reminder?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe rule of thumb is one business week. If you interviewed on a Tuesday, wait until the next Tuesday to email them (as J.T. O'Donnell says, never send a nudge on a Monday). When you do, don’t push or be blunt. Keep it short and sweet:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Interviewer],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope you had a great week!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wanted to quickly follow up and see if there was anything else I could help with regarding the application process. If so, please let me know.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s it. If they don’t respond to that after another 3–4 days, you have your answer and it’s time to move on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat Happens If They Say No?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUgh. The worst case scenario. Don’t get down just yet though, we’re not done here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have this quality where I have trouble taking “no” as an answer. When I was interviewing with Google, the initial screener told me that she wasn’t going to put me through because she “didn’t think I was qualified, and didn’t want to waste the team’s time.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was not happy. So I sent her this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Recruiter],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThank you again for carving out the time to speak this afternoon. I really appreciate your feedback, and I wanted to add one final note:\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I completely understand your concerns regarding my experience with [skill]. You are correct that I didn’t have much experience with that at [previous company]. That said, this doesn’t stem from an inability to produce results, but rather a lack of opportunity to do so.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile my experience on paper may not match up to the initial expectations of the position’s description, I have do have two qualities that work in my favor: I am an extremely efficient learner, and am also very effective at translating those learnings into practice. Second, I’m much more tenacious than your average individual. My career has hinged on these two qualities.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I left college with no digital experience and a biology degree — all of my digital knowledge was obtained through self study. I spent 8 months selling myself without the on-paper experience to back it up. When I was finally given the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a business setting, I playing a critical role in landing the company’s 2nd largest deal in history. I am confident that I can have the same success in this role. I have the resources necessary to learn what I need in order to be successful at [company], and am prepared to do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I understand that [company’s] interview process is extremely challenging, and that only the top talent ends up with an offer letter at the end. I also believe that I am worthy of a shot at that letter. [Company] is known for hiring people who excel at the intangibles, as well the ability to learn new things and apply them to existing knowledge. That is my forte.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I am not asking for an offer. I am simply asking for the opportunity to speak with the hiring manager to make my case for the position. I’m sure you will find the best person for the position, I would just like to have a legitimate shot at being that person. If you give me that chance, my next set of answers will not disappoint.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Thank you again for your continued consideration.\u003cbr /\u003e Best,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that may be a little aggressive…\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOk, it was pretty aggressive. But she wrote me back an hour later and pushed me through to the next round! Mission accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe moral of the story here is, don’t give up if you get a “No.” Try to identify why you were turned down and then send a note to hiring manager addressing those items (feel free to copy mine).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTaking Action\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere you have it. The exhaustive, step-by-step guide to landing an interview and then getting an offer from the company of your dreams. What are you waiting for? Get out there and start researching!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eFor several days not that long ago, Jordan Reid's site, ramshackleglam.com, did not belong to her. She got it back, but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies, middle-of-the-night conferences with lawyers, FBI intervention, and what amounted to a massive sting operation. Here's her story. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten by Jordan Reid: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/vmvaughn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ramshackleglam\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead by Abbey Rennemeyer: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2EA3OjL\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2EA3OjL\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript: \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor several days not so long ago, RamshackleGlam.com — the domain name that I have owned and operated since March of 2010 — did not belong to me, but rather to a man who goes by the name “bahbouh” on an auction website called Flippa, and who was attempting to sell off the site to the highest bidder (with a “Buy It Now” price of $30,000.00). He promised the winner my traffic, my files, and my data, and suggested that I was available “for hire” to continue writing posts (alternatively, he was willing to provide the winner with “high-quality articles” and “SEO advice” to maintain the site’s traffic post-sale).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI learned that my site was stolen on a Saturday. Three days later I had it back, but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies, middle-of-the-night conferences with lawyers, FBI intervention, and what amounted to a sting operation that probably should have starred Sandra Bullock instead of…well…me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf course I’ve heard of identity theft, and of cyber hacking, but honestly, my attitude towards these things was very much “it could never happen to me.” And even if it did…I didn’t exactly understand why it was such a huge deal. Couldn’t you just explain to people what had happened, prove who you were, and sort it all out? We live in such a highly documented world, it seemed completely impossible to me that someone could actually get away with pretending to be someone else with any real consequences beyond a few phone calls and some irritation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s much, much worse — more threatening, more upsetting, and more difficult (if not impossible) to fix — than I’d ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI found out about the hacking from my father. His friend Anthony (who runs a web development and consulting company called ThoughtBox) had been surfing around on Flippa and had — in an impossibly lucky coincidence — noticed that my site was up for auction, with what appeared to be a highly suspicious listing. Suddenly, I remembered the email I had gotten the day before — an email that I had disregarded as spam — from someone “interested in the purchase” of my “weblog.” I remembered the notification from YouTube that someone had accessed my account from a different location — a notification I had ignored, assuming that I had logged in on a mobile device or that my husband had accidentally logged into my account instead of his own.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut even after I saw the listing, I didn’t panic: this seemed like something that could be fixed with a couple of emails. Except the auction site was located in Australia and didn’t appear to have a phone number, and when I sent an email with a scanned ID and proof of ownership what I got back was a form letter. And when I called HostMonster, the site I pay to operate my website, I discovered that I was no longer the owner of my site: someone had used their email confirmation system to authorize the transfer of my domain name into a private account at GoDaddy (another web registrar service of whom I’m also a client).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy is this a big deal?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you have a business that depends on a URL, you understand why this was such upsetting news: With control over my website’s domain name, a hacker would be able to take the site down, or redirect it elsewhere. Further, it was later verified that the hacker had control over all of the site’s content, as well; he could have just rerouted everything I’ve ever written to any location he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRamshackle Glam may be “just” a lifestyle blog about things like parenting and fashion and decor…but it’s also a site that I’ve spent five years of my life building, and the idea of it falling into the hands of someone with malicious intent was heartbreaking. I could switch to a new URL and export a copy of my content (which I do back up), but that would result in the loss of a substantial amount of traffic. The website is my primary source of income, and with a house, two children, a book coming out, and a husband in business school, this was not a joke. The loss of my URL had the potential to be devastating for my business and for my family in a very real way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo what did I do?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe events of the next few days were complicated, so rather than go through them chronologically I’m going to explain how each path I took ended up panning out (I’m going into detail so that I can be as much help as possible to anyone who goes through this themselves).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. I tried to resolve the situation directly with GoDaddy and HostMonster. This did not work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom Sunday through Tuesday, I spent most of the day (and much of the night) on the phone with GoDaddy, HostMonster, or both at the same time, and nearly every person I spoke with gave me the same response: “Sorry, can’t help you.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHostMonster maintained that because they no longer controlled the domain name, there was nothing they could do. GoDaddy maintained that because the account was private and the person had obtained ownership of the domain through a transfer from HostMonster, there was nothing they could do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat finally made a difference: I cited ICANN’s policy on Domain Name Dispute Resolution.* This got my case upgraded, but it did not result in action.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s why: the legal department at HostMonster informed me that in order for them to initiate a transfer dispute that would result in GoDaddy releasing the domain back to me, their “internal investigation” would have to turn up evidence that they had done something wrong in releasing the site. In other words, they would have to admit that they had screwed up…which would in turn open them up to a lawsuit.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, I never heard from the legal department again. Despite the fact that everyone seemed clear on the fact that I owned my website and that it had been transferred without my authorization, nothing was going to be done unless I initiated a time-consuming and costly lawsuit that, in any case, would not result in action quick enough to save my domain name from being sold.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo that avenue came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. I called the FBI. This was a major step in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe morning after I found out about the unauthorized transfer, I also called the FBI. I felt silly and dramatic making the phone call, but the reality is that this is an international cyber crime issue, and that’s FBI territory. And this is my business. It’s how I support my family, and it may be a “small matter” in the grand scheme of things, but it is not a small matter to me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd let me tell you: of all the surprises I’ve had over the past week or so, most surprising of all has been the FBI. They responded immediately, with follow-up phone calls and emails, an in-person interview with two special agents at my own home within 24 hours, and a follow-up visit from two agents yesterday. Beyond that, each and every agent I have interacted with over the past week has been, without fail, compassionate, thoughtful, invested, respectful, and committed to action…in addition to treating me not like a case number, but like a human.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I expected was to leave a message with a general mailbox and at some point receive a form letter; I certainly did not expect to see an active investigation opened immediately. I’m not going to write more about the investigation because it’s still ongoing (although I did ask for and receive permission to write about this), but I think it’s important to say how absolutely blown away I have been by the FBI’s response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. I tried to regain control by dealing directly with the “seller”. This worked, but not without considerable drama.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile all of the above was going on, I was also working to regain control over the site directly from the individual who was trying to sell it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to contact the “seller” directly, because I felt that if he thought the “real” owner of the site was aware of the sale, he would try to extort more money. So I asked Anthony — the person who had found the original listing, and who had an active account with a positive history on Flippa — to DM “bahbouh” to see if he was interested in a “private sale”. After some back-and-forth we reached an agreement, and it was decided that a third-party money-transfer website (Escrow.com) would be used to make the sale: the money would only be released to the seller upon confirmation that the domain name had been transferred.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis appeared to be going smoothly until Tuesday night, when the seller suddenly demanded that the funds be released immediately (prior to receipt of the website). When we pushed back, he announced that he was selling it to someone else: “Sorry, bye.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo here was my thought process: if we did not release the money to the seller, we were guaranteed to not get the website. If we did release the money to him, there was a possibility that he would take the money and run, and also a possibility that he would deliver the site as promised. It wasn’t a gamble I wanted to take…but I didn’t see any option. And so I authorized the wire transfer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent twenty minutes sitting in front of the dummy GoDaddy account I had created to receive the domain name from the seller, waiting to see whether I was out thousands of dollars and a domain name, or just thousands of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd then it came through.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI immediately transferred the domain into a different account and placed it (and all of my other domain names) on what amounted to lockdown. And then I called the wire transfer company and placed a stop on the payment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe end result\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRamshackleGlam.com is back in my possession, thanks to a number of people who dedicated hours (in some cases days) out of their lives to doing whatever they could to help me. My other accounts — bank accounts, et cetera — have been secured. I don’t have my money back yet, but the man who stole my site from me doesn’t have it, either, and won’t be getting it, ever.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd that’s an ending I’m pretty damn thrilled with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo why am I still angry?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf course I’m angry with the person or people who stole the site, but that’s out of my hands. The reason I’m writing this post is to let people know that this really can happen — to anyone — and to offer suggestions for how to minimize the chances that it will happen to you (below), but beyond that, I’m writing this post because this incident made me very, very angry at GoDaddy and HostMonster. And I want you to know why.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNo one at either company questioned my statement (supported by written proof) that the website belonged to me. No one doubted that it had been transferred without my authority. And yet I had to spend days — days during which the hacker could have done virtually anything he wanted — trying to reach one single person who was able to do anything, because the support staff and supervisors I spoke with (who had to have numbered fifty or more) were completely uninformed as to how to handle this situation beyond saying, “Jeez, that sucks. Can’t help you.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd once I reached people who could help me — who could literally make a single phone call or push a single button and return my property to me (or simply freeze it so that it could not be sold or destroyed) — they would not. They hid behind their legal departments and refused to do anything, knowing full well that their inaction would force me to either interact with and pay off a criminal, or lose an essential component of my business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd hackers know that these companies will do this.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey rely on it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a serious problem when a criminal enterprise not only exists “despite” a company’s policies, but actually thrives as a direct result of that company’s prioritization of their own interests over the security of the clients they allegedly “protect”. Do I understand why companies like HostMonster and GoDaddy are focused on protecting themselves against lawsuits? Of course I do. But the fact is that they not only do not “help” their customers, but actively contribute to creating situations that threaten small businesses and the families that they support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd these companies know that when they stonewall clients whose property has obviously been stolen that these clients will have no other recourse than to pay off criminals or watch their businesses — sometimes their very lives — collapse. They know that by standing in the way of immediate action they create the very environment that these criminals depend upon to perpetuate their business model. And they do nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis has to change.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy opinion, for what it’s worth\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSupport personnel at hosting companies should be made intimately familiar with ICANN regulations involving domain disputes, and should be able to initiate a plan of action the first time a client makes them aware of a situation, not after hours and hours of repeated calls.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFurther, the establishment of a TEAC** should result in an immediate freeze on the account in dispute until the situation has been resolved. This should not require an admission of culpability on the part of any parties; simply an acknowledgement that a dispute exists and an awareness that while the dispute exists the domain must be held safe from sale or transfer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat you can do to reduce the chances that this will happen to you:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHave a really, really good password, and change it often. Your password should not contain “real” words (and definitely not more than one real word in immediate proximity, like “whitecat” or “angrybird”), and should contain capital letters, numbers and symbols. The best passwords of all look like total nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf possible, use a separate computer (an old one or a cheap one purchased for this purpose) for things like banking; if your family computer is the same one that you use for bank transactions you risk having your kids click on a bad link that results in a hacking.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTurn off your computer and personal devices when they’re not in use.\u003cbr /\u003e Have antivirus software on your computer (but remember that virus scans only catch 30–40% of viruses, so unfortunately a “clean” check doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re safe).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePurchase CyberRisk Insurance (learn more about it here; it basically protects businesses from cyber attacks and data breaches.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut if it does happen to you, here’s what to do:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBegin taking careful notes (and screenshots) immediately.

I changed mine every few hours while this situation was still up in the air, and am continuing to change them every few days for the time being.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eContact the registrar(s), citing the ICANN policy below, and see if together you can arrive at a speedy resolution. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself running into dead ends.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake sure to inquire about “filters” and “rules” that may have been placed on your email (basically, any kind of device that the hackers may have placed to forward emails, et cetera).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eContact appropriate law enforcement (I contacted the FBI because it appeared to be an international issue, and was at the very least an interstate issue because Escrow.com is located in California, and I’m in New York).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote: Every situation is different, and I can’t wholeheartedly recommend the steps that I took that ultimately resulted in me regaining control over my domain name largely because they involved interacting with criminals. Obviously that isn’t ideal, and can have unpredictable consequences. (Although my husband says that he would like it to be known that he thinks I’m a huge badass. While this is ordinarily very far from the truth, in this specific instance…I’ll take it.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe End. (That was long.

I wrote this guide because I want to help others with non-traditional backgrounds succeed on take-home coding challenges. Please read it, take notes, apply the material, and let me know about your results. You can reach me via email at jane@fullstackinterviewing.com.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis guide is intended for anyone who has received a take-home coding challenge as part of the technical interview process and wants to attack it in the best way. This Essential Guide is a distilled version of a longer Ultimate Guide to Take-home Coding Challenges, which goes into much more detail and walks through an example challenge from start to finish.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, if you’ve just received a challenge and are anxious to get started, start here, and then check out the full guide when you want to learn the material more deeply. Good luck!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMistakes to avoid making when working on a take-home coding challenge\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are several mistakes you can make with take-home challenges. Some of these are small mistakes that are easily correctable, while others will leave you frustrated and unable to finish your assignment. I want to address these mistakes first, so when you’re given a take-home challenge, you know exactly what not to do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are four mistakes you can make:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Time management and scope creep\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Trying to learn too many new things at once\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Making too many assumptions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Starting to code right away\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s look at each one in detail.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Time management and scope creep\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTime estimation is one of the hardest problems in programming, and even experienced engineers struggle with it. This plays into take-home challenges in a couple of ways.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, some challenges come with “estimated time.” I usually ignore these, as they are rarely based in reality. Second, some challenges are open-ended. Many people, especially newer developers, will want to add tons of features because they think it will be impressive. Actually, it’s more impressive if you keep the scope relatively narrow, but finish everything you set out to do. In this situation, it’s better to do one thing really well than to do a million things poorly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA good question would be: what counts as “going above and beyond” versus what counts as “scope creep?” My rule of thumb would be if your idea accomplishes or improves on the requirements of the assignment, that is likely a good idea, but if it seems tangentially related or “just cool,” it’s probably scope creep. But, as I describe later, always make it work first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Trying to learn too many new things at once\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile a take-home coding challenge can be an excellent opportunity for learning, it is possible to take on too much learning. If you’re given a challenge where you must use a specific language or framework, but you’re not familiar with it, don’t add additional complexity by setting out to learn something new on top of that. For example, if you are using a new backend framework for a full stack app, stick to a frontend framework that you’re already comfortable with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf your challenge is language/framework agnostic, but you’ve been itching to try out some new technology, pick JUST ONE to experiment with. Between reading the docs, getting your challenge properly set up, and getting used to any new syntax, you will have your hands full. Even learning one thing will eat up a lot of your time, so I would highly suggest limiting yourself to one new piece of technology per challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Making too many assumptions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a developer, if you make too many assumptions, you are bound to build an application where the requirements are off, or the user experience is bad. When given a set of requirements for a take-home challenge, ALWAYS take the time to review the requirements and make sure you fully understand them. And, if you have any questions at all, always ask.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, this shows that you are willing to ask for help when you don’t quite understand something, an important trait for a developer to demonstrate. Second, many companies will intentionally give you product requirements that are vague or not fully fleshed out in order to see how you react in these situations. They are actually testing your ability to make sense of requirements that may have gaps in them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, when in doubt, ask questions. Asking questions is also a signal that you are engaged and interested in the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Starting to code right away\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne last mistake you can make is to jump in and start coding right away. I guarantee if you do this, you will regret it. Why? Two reasons:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWithout proper planning, your code will suffer\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWithout first getting organized and making sure you fully understand ALL of the technical requirements, you may find yourself missing edge cases or rewriting parts of the functionality. I know it seems counter-intuitive, but you will actually SAVE yourself time if you plan ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou will spin your wheels trying to get your app set up properly\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEspecially for newer developers, initial app setup can be one of the hardest parts of a take-home coding challenge. It’s not something you do every day, so it often takes some research and reading documentation to get reacquainted with the process and ensure you’re going about it in the best way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, there you have it — a summary of mistakes to avoid making. You’ll find that a lot of these are also applicable to your day to day work as a developer. In the next section, we’ll dive into further detail on how to get organized before you write a single line of code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet organized: how to plan before you write a line of code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow it’s time to get to work! But, it’s NOT time to write any code YET.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause, as you’ll see, a lot of the work actually happens before you write a single line of code. This may seem counterintuitive, but again — the more time you spend up front planning, the less time you will spend writing code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, now you have your coding challenge in hand and you are ready to get started with the planning process. Here are my six suggested steps:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Understand the requirements and ask any questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Identify technical decisions you need to make\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Technical design \u0026 whiteboarding\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. App setup plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. Organize your tasks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Understand the requirements and ask any questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, you need to make sure you completely, absolutely, 100% understand the requirements of the project. If any part of the requirements are unclear, it is up to you to reach out to your contact and ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSometimes companies will purposefully make their requirements vague, in order to see how you approach the problem. In these cases, it is always best to ask questions as it shows you are thinking about the problem and not just making assumptions and building an app to a vague spec.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Identify technical decisions you need to make\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour next step will be to identify the technical decisions that you need to make. Making a list of all of your technical decisions up front and thinking about them before you’re in the middle of building your app will help you immensely. Not only will it cut down on time figuring things out later, but it will allow you to make big picture decisions up front, as opposed to trying to focus on both the big picture and the small details at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Technical design \u0026 whiteboarding\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow it’s time to plan out the rest of your app. For anything that you need to draw out, now is the perfect time to do that. Thinking through these decisions at the start serves two purposes:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ll be able to reference these drawings and your original plan while you’re building your app. Then if you get stuck at any point, you can always come back to your notes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, when you are having a discussion with an engineer about your coding challenge, you can use these notes as a reference when they ask you why you made certain design or architecture decisions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve thought through and answered some of the bigger design and architecture questions for your challenge, the next step is research. If you’re planning to use a new technology or something you’re a bit rusty with, use this time to search for documentation and other resources.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnother very important step to take before writing a line of code is developing a test plan. Although you won’t get peer feedback on this test plan, it will help you look at the challenge from a different angle, making sure you’re meeting all of the requirements. By thinking through and writing out a test plan before you start coding, you are able to brainstorm possible edge cases that you should account for in your code and you will use this as a basis for testing your app later.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. App setup plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re starting an app from scratch, figure out if there are any generators you can use to make your app setup easier and faster. Application setup is one of the hardest parts of take-home coding challenges, because it’s something that developers do rather infrequently. Best practices are always changing, so it’s easy to forget how to do. Also, when setting up an app with a specific combination of technologies for the first time, it can be challenging to get everything configured and working together properly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you are not using a generator, reading documentation and finding working examples are the two most important steps you can take. Being able to play with a working example and compare it to your own app will help you if you get stuck.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. Organize your tasks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe last step before you start coding is to break down and organize your tasks. Breaking down your tasks is essential because it will help you stay on track as you’re working on your challenge, and it will give you a game plan for execution. Note that you shouldn’t be a perfectionist here, because there will always be unexpected bumps in the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is an example task list for a classic Tic Tac Toe app:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Understand requirements\u003cbr /\u003e - Choose technologies\u003cbr /\u003e - Brainstorm test plan\u003cbr /\u003e - Hello World app setup\u003cbr /\u003e - Build board with HTML/CSS\u003cbr /\u003e - Implement Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript\u003cbr /\u003e - Add reset button\u003cbr /\u003e - Make board responsive\u003cbr /\u003e - Add ability to add additional boards\u003cbr /\u003e - Error handling \u0026 tests\u003cbr /\u003e - Code cleanup\u003cbr /\u003e - README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome of these tasks can be broken down even further into smaller steps. For example, in order to implement the Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript, here are some smaller tasks:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Add a click handler to each square that logs a message\u003cbr /\u003e - Get click handler to add an X to the square that is clicked\u003cbr /\u003e - Get clicks to alternate between X and O\u003cbr /\u003e - Don’t allow a square to be clicked more than once\u003cbr /\u003e - Implement a function to find the winner and end the game\u003cbr /\u003e - Handle a tie game\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Writing tests: just do it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTesting can be overwhelming, because there are so many different types of tests: acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests, not to mention test driven development vs. ad hoc testing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy should you include tests in your take-home coding challenge? It’s simple: your tests will make your submission shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, adding tests shows that you know or are willing to learn another technology/framework. It also demonstrates that you take ownership of what you’re building, because you are taking responsibility to make sure it works. Testing also shows that you’ve considered edge cases, which many newer engineers often overlook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany companies take tests very seriously. Some will not tell you that they expect tests for your coding challenge, but will automatically reject you if you leave them out. Therefore, my recommendation is to write tests no matter what when given a take-home challenge. Not only will it make you a better developer, but for companies that were not expecting tests, you will stand out even more!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow do you go about writing a tests? First, create a plan. Here’s my 80/20 suggestion for how to come up with the right test cases:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Test the happy path\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the classic Tic Tac Toe example, the happy path is starting with an empty board and playing a game until X wins.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Think about variations on the happy path\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA variation on the happy path would be if O wins, or if there is a tie game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Think of edge cases\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn edge case would be if a player tries to play a move in the same square more than once.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test anything that is complex\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe algorithm to find the winner is the most complex part of this example.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s a sample test plan:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Test that the initial state of the board is correct (i.e. board is\u003cbr /\u003e visible and empty)\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a move can be played\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that moves alternate between X and O\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a move can be played to a square only once\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a row\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a column\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a diagonal\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a draw can be found\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, now it’s your turn. Think about your app and, as a baseline, think of 5–10 tests that you can write.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe title of this section sums it up pretty well, but when you’re working on building out your challenge, you should follow these 3 steps IN THIS ORDER:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Make it work\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make it pretty\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Make it work\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you’re given a take-home coding challenge, no matter what you do, the most crucial part of the challenge is to make it work. If you submit an app that has a nice UI, that will not matter if your app does not work or meet all of the requirements. Because building features to spec is a key aspect of your future job as a developer, you first and foremost need to focus on the functionality of your app and prioritize that above all else.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is also key if you are low on or run out of time. Coding challenges can be a lot of work, especially if you want to go above and beyond to ensure that you make it to the next interview round. But, I can guarantee that you will not make it to the next round if your app doesn’t function properly or is missing some key components.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, if you’re building a front-end app, this means focusing on making it work first, and styling/UI last. If you are building a back-end or full-stack app, focus on making it work before trying to refactor your code into the most elegant solution, and only then worry about optimization.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven if you end up without any time to go back and refactor your code or style your UI, having a working app to present is more important. You can always talk to the interviewer about how you would improve your app, and refactoring some of your code might even be part of the next round of interviewing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make it pretty\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake it pretty has two interpretations here. One is making the code pretty, and the other is making the UI pretty. Making the code pretty can be done in several ways. First, ensure indentation is consistent and your code is readable. Second, if you got something to work in a quick, hacky way, think about how you can refactor it to be a more elegant solution without overcomplicating it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re doing a front-end or full-stack challenge, you can also make the UI pretty as part of this step. Whether you use a library or write your own custom styles for your app, making the UI look good will show your interviewer that you’re taking the user experience into consideration when building a feature.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor some more front-end-focused challenges, you’ll be given a specific mockup to match. In these cases, making sure you’re detail oriented down to the last pixel is incredibly important. Part of your role may involve translating mockups from designers into user interfaces, so companies want to get a sense of how you approach those types of tasks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve made your app work, made it pretty (in the code, UI, or both), it may be time to make it fast! This is where understanding performance and BigO notation comes in handy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou should take a look at your code and see if there are any areas where increasing the scale might be an issue. For example, are you using a double for loop somewhere? What if the arrays you’re looping over become super long?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you think about these kinds of edge cases, you can then come up with plan to improve your code. Taking something that would have been running O(n) and making it O(1) will show that you’re thinking about performance when you’re building things.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to make your code shine\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen given a take-home coding challenge, many people think about how to build an app that works, but stop there. In this section, I’ll go over things an engineer reviewing your code will look for, so you can take your challenge to the next level and make your code shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen an engineer is reviewing your code, they will look for several different things. They will likely try to run your app to play around with it and see it working. After that, they will delve into the actual code, looking to see how you organized your app architecture and reading code in individual files.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are several things you can do to make your code stand out. You want your code to be:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReadable\u003cbr /\u003e Easy to follow\u003cbr /\u003e Well organized\u003cbr /\u003e Clean (properly indented, free of syntax errors and unnecessary whitespace)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are the basics that don’t take much effort outside of mindfulness to get right. Now let’s talk about three of the more involved code style considerations:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. How to name things\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How to use comments effectively\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. How to format your code as you write it\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. How to name things\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNaming is one of the hardest problems in programming. One of the keys to naming things is to make sure you’re naming them in a way that another developer who is unfamiliar with the code can easily jump in and understand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor functions, think about what exactly the function is doing. Is the function checking whether there is a winner on a row of a Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be checkRow. Is your function handling a click on a square of the Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be handleClick.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne quick tip: if you find yourself losing your flow because you keep stopping to think of the perfect name, split your process into two steps. First, write working code with any names (like foo, bar, and baz). Then take a second pass through to improve them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How to use comments effectively\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdding comments can be a great way to capture what you were thinking at the time you wrote a specific piece of code. This can be useful to you, or anyone else who comes across your code in the future and needs to understand it, tweak it, or rewrite it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThink of comments as adding clarity to your code. But, pay attention, because there is such a thing as too many comments.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is where you most likely do not need comments:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you declare a variable\u003cbr /\u003e When you declare a function\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe variable or function name should be enough to explain exactly what it does. If you need a comment to explain it, then you need to give it a better name!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of where comments can be useful:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHTML\u003cbr /\u003e CSS\u003cbr /\u003e Technically tricky lines of code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s talk about HTML. Markup seems pretty self-explanatory, right? So, why would you need comments? Let’s say you have a really long HTML file with A LOT of \u003cdiv\u003es. Comments can be a good way to signal which \u003c/div\u003e tags close which sections.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn CSS, comments are a good way to divide up your styles if you have a lot of styles in one file. This way, when you come back to the code later and want to make a change, it’s easier to find the styles for that one section you need to update.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eComments in CSS are also very useful whenever you are hard-coding any math or adding an arbitrary number of pixels as margin, padding, and so on. Comments can be useful to explain things like this that are specific to your application.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the best uses for comments is when you’ve written code that is technically difficult or just not intuitive. You should always strive for simple, understandable code as much as possible. However, sometimes you will have confusing code — maybe you’ve chained a bunch of methods together or are using a complex regular expression — and it would help to explain what is happening in a comment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou are almost done learning how to make your code shine! Just one more step.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. How to format your code as you write it\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m a STICKLER about formatting when it comes to code. And, it’s not just me. You’ll find that the best engineers also care about well-formatted, clean code. Why? First, it’s much easier to read! Coding can be really challenging, so when code is easier to read, it makes our jobs as developers that much easier. Also, writing clean code sends a message to your interviewers that you take pride in the craft of writing code, and for many teams, this is a big deal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, how do you make sure the code style sticklers will approve of your code? There are a few simple tricks you can use as you’re working through your coding challenge to ensure the end result comes out clean and you don’t have to spend time at the end reformatting everything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eChoose tabs or spaces and be consistent across your entire application (i.e. no 2 spaces in some files, 4 spaces in others)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndent your code properly as you go so that it stays readable and isn’t all over the place\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet rid of trailing whitespace! Whitespace can sometimes wreck havoc, so it’s best to just get rid of it as you write your code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKeep your syntax consistent throughout your entire app. If you’re using a linter, this will be easier, but requires setting one up. If you don’t have time to set one up, pay attention. Don’t use ES5 in some places in your app and ES6 in others. Pick one and stick with it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemove unnecessary logging and debug statements when you’re done using them! Unless logging is part of your application, you’ll want to remove any temporary statements you were using while building your app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlways leave a newline at the end of every file\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s it! It’s pretty simple, and once you’re in the habit of doing this, not only will your code be easier for you to read, but it will also be easier for others to read and maintain. Many new developers haven’t been exposed to very much code maintenance, but trust me, when you have to clean up code someone else has written, you will be more thankful if it was neatly organized to start. Pay it forward!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to take your challenge to the next level\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are 3 ideas for how you can take your coding challenge to the next level:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Bonuses\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. UI/UX design (for front-end or full-stack challenges)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Data validation and error handling\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Bonuses\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNot all coding challenges come with bonuses, but if yours does and your goal is to get a job offer, do them! Why? It’s pretty simple. If you go above and beyond in your coding challenge, it will show that you will go above and beyond once you’re hired at this company. Completing bonus requirements is a high competence trigger for the interviewer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. UI/UX design (for front-end or full-stack challenges)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome front-end or full-stack challenges will mention UI/UX design as a bonus, but if they don’t, putting in some effort to make the UI look nice and be easy to use will go a long way. You can either go the route of adding your own custom CSS or plugging in a library or two to help make your styling even more painless. If you use a library, just make sure that you understand how it works enough to explain how you’ve used it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Data validation and error handling\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eData validation and error handling are key components in production apps. Adding either one of these (or both!) to your challenge will help make it stand out. Many developers who are new to coding and haven’t worked in a production codebase before don’t have a ton of exposure to either of these, so if you add error handling for edge cases it will show that you thought through a lot of different situations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to write an awesome README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may be done writing code, but you’re not done writing yet — it’s time to write your README.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy you should include a README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eREADMEs are incredibly important, both for professional developers and for job seekers working on take-home challenges. Including a README shows that you care about documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDocumentation helps spread knowledge across teams and serves as a supplement to your code. Having documentation for your take-home challenge ensures that anyone else (or future you) can jump into your code with a clear understanding of what you’ve built without any guessing games.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour README is also the KEY to making sure that everyone reviewing your challenge has the most painless experience possible. Finally, your README is a way of proving to your reviewer that you successfully met the requirements of the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to write your README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWriting a great README is not hard, and you will stand out a great deal from the other applicants with one. Here are the five sections I’d recommend you include:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Installation instructions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Discussion of technologies used\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. A section demonstrating that you met the requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Installation instructions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen writing your README, don’t make any assumptions. Write out all of the steps to run your app locally and test them yourself. This includes cloning the repo from Github, running installation commands, and starting up a server. Also, make sure to include versions of software that you are using. This will ensure that the developer reviewing your code has a seamless experience setting up and running your app, and if they do happen to run into any trouble due to versioning, they will have all of the information they need right there in the README.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Discussion of technologies used\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis section is as simple as it sounds — make a list of all of the technologies you used including frameworks and libraries. If you had to find a library for a specific piece of functionality in your take-home challenge, mention it here and include a link to the docs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. A section demonstrating that you met the requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUsually your take-home challenge will come with some sort of requirements spec, so make sure to include a section in your README where you describe the requirements and how you met them. In some cases, you can take the product spec you were given and write a short explanation of how you met each requirement in a list. In other cases, you can simply include a short paragraph explaining how you satisfied the requirements. It’s totally up to you how you do it, just make sure you include it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSimilar to the requirements section above, you’ll want to highlight any bonuses you completed while working on the take-home challenge. If you attempted a bonus, but couldn’t quite get something to work, then the README is also a good place to address that. You can discuss the approach or approaches you tried and what worked or didn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you had to write any algorithms or data structures as part of your take-home challenge, it’s helpful to include the space-time complexity of your final algorithm. This can be done in Big O notation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne final word of advice: write your README in markdown so it looks nice! This will demonstrate that you know (or are willing to learn) another language that will come in handy as a full-time developer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinal steps before you hit send\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you’ve written your README, you’re almost ready to hit send! Before you do that, take the time to double check all of your work using the following checklist:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRe-read the take-home challenge instructions to make sure you didn’t miss any requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReview your app’s code to ensure that it shines\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRun your app’s automated tests and make sure they are all passing\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTest your app manually and make sure everything is working properly\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTest your app installation instructions from your README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStart an email draft and copy your README into it for convenience\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf requested, make sure to attach a zip file of your code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWrite an email to your contact at the company\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour email can be short and sweet — I always like to highlight something I enjoyed about the challenge or something I learned. Here’s an example:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi \u003cNAME\u003e,\u003cbr /\u003e I hope you had a great week! I had fun diving back into React with this challenge. Here is my Github repo and I’ve included my README below. Please let me know if you have any questions.\u003cbr /\u003e Just so you know, I’m interviewing with a few other companies and I just received an offer yesterday — I need to get back to them next week. Of course, I am excited about the opportunity at \u003cCOMPANY NAME\u003e, so I’m looking forward to hearing from you!\u003cbr /\u003e Thanks,\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cNAME\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote that you should only mention interviewing with other companies or offer deadlines if either is actually the case. I feel you should be honest and candid about your situation and maintain leverage for a potential future compensation negotiation at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow, finally, hit send!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope this Essential Guide was helpful and you learned something that you can apply to a take-home challenge or in your day-to-day work.

Because I love it. And I’ve got a knack for it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s hard. And that’s OK.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI love losing myself in an algorithm challenge. I love squeezing in a few extra minutes testing just one more thing. I love thinking “maybe I’ve got it this time.” And getting to “Yes! It finally works!”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut here’s the thing. I’ve never been one for hobbies. I don’t like activities that don’t pay. I can’t keep on doing something simply for the fun of it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I work on during my off time has to have some economic upside for me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOK, coding pays. It can pay big. So what’s the problem?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, before I could fully embrace myself as a 56-year-old programming rookie, I had to deal with my Critical Inner Self (let’s call him CIS for short).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearning all this stuff is hard enough without my CIS whispering in my ear the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf I can give my CIS an epic beat-down, then I should be able to handle anyone who appears to work on his behalf. And these agents of CIS often appear out of no where, asking critical questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Why are you doing this at your age?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: What you really mean is how much longer will I live. And do I really have enough time left to make money programming. Let’s break that down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m an American. My life expectancy is 78.8 years. So that means I’ve got a better than average chance of living another 22.8 years. That may not seem like a lot when you’re 20, but I’m 56 and dancing in the street over here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e(And because I’m 56, I’ve got better odds of making it to 78 than a 20 year old. But that’s beside the point.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow, let’s say I’m a snail and it takes me 4 years to finish Free Code Camp’s 1-year curriculum to become a fledgling full stack developer. That puts me at 60 years old looking for a job as a junior developer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say it takes me another 2 years to land a job because of my age, and let’s assume that 70 is the limit for how long an employer wants me hanging around.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s 8 years to practice my craft. That’s plenty of runway to get pretty good. And because I’ve been around the block and know the grass ain’t always greener on the other side, I’m much more likely to stay with that employer who hired me first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat 20-year-old stays with their first developer job that long?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: But who’s going to pay you the kind of money that you already make now?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: You could ask me that even if I didn’t learn to program. But I know what you’re getting at. Chances are an entry level developer job will pay me less than I’m making now.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell here’s a thought for you. My paycheck is less today than it was five years ago. And that’s with 5 more years of experience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere’s no guarantee that the job I have now will last. And when it doesn’t, I’ll have to find a new job anyway. At my age, I very well may have to accept entry level wages doing something… anything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’d rather have the skills and portfolio to go for an entry level position that can lead to much greater earnings — or at least the ability to beat the bushes and pick up some freelance work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: But all the big tech companies want to hire young kids right out of college.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: That’s easy. I don’t want to move to Silicon Valley and I’m not looking to work for a big tech company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ve read the same stats as me. By 2020 there will be 1,000,000 more programming jobs than people trained to fill them. Not all of those openings will be at the “big 4” — Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft. In fact, most programming jobs aren’t even in the technology industry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy first computer job was in a hospital. I didn’t program, but most of the employees in the IT department were programmers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd that was way back in 1982.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Then how are you going to get a job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: First things first, I’m going to apply to a lot of jobs, build a network of hiring managers, and make sure I get a lot of interviews. It’s a numbers game and I’m going to play it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll that wonderful stuff I did before the year 2000? Gone from my resume.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce I’m in the door for an interview, it’s not like I’m going to act like someone’s grandfather. I’ll be just another candidate who’s passionate about programming and excited to learn more. And I won’t act like I know more than I do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd most importantly, I’ll be prepared for common coding challenges and whiteboard interview questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m sure I’ll mess up a few interviews. But the good news? There are plenty of companies out there hiring developers. I’ll keep trying.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Programming teams are full of young people. How are you going to fit in?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: If by “fit in” you mean how do I become one of the bros? In that case, you’re right.

In particular, non-technical leaders have earned a poor reputation with software developers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOffice Space depicts the non-technical manager in Bill Lumbergh, pictured above. Dilbert provides the classic “Pointy-Haired Boss.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis article is for anyone who wants to effectively orchestrate a development process without becoming the butt of your team’s water-cooler jokes. I’ll share what I’ve learned over the years managing development and release processes as a manager and software architect at UCLA and Stanford University.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe biggest lesson I’ve learned is that the key to sustaining successful software releases is completely non-technical.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s about process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome aspects of a development process benefit from technical know-how, but it’s not required. Successfully releasing software into production is much more a question of robust process architecture than design or code alone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the purpose of this article, we’ll assume you’ve already agreed to start building something. The product approval pipeline is a different process. Today we’re focusing on getting the agreed-upon product from concept to production.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat to build\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour team needs to assemble a clear roadmap for their code. Architects and manufacturers use blueprints. You should too.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour roadmap should include a set of schematics which each fulfill a different purpose. These schematics differ for individual applications. A user-interface mock-up, application architecture diagram, and business process model are common. More detailed component diagrams such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flow models are often useful as well.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTechnical expertise lets you use these schematics to critique your team’s architecture and ensure they’re on the right track. Even without technical skill, these schematics will be critical.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can use them to drive productive conversations about product completion. No more will you have to draw a “% complete” out of thin air or best-guess from the development team. You can track the status of each item on the diagram to determine how close the app is to completion. You can also project future velocity based on how quickly the team completed prior components.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is no “right” amount of pre-development documentation, but there is one wrong amount: none. Work out with your team what constitutes an acceptable roadmap before they start coding. The first checkpoint in your development process will be to review this documentation and ensure they’ve met this agreement.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat not to build\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour team can’t build everything. Nor should they. You need to ensure that your developers have a laser focus on what they actually need to build.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy are you building this app in the first place? Define the key differentiation from existing products. 80% of your team’s time should go toward supporting that differentiation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe schematics you should now have will be helpful here. Does your application include a logging component? A sign-up and login process? There are already excellent free, open-source software (FOSS) frameworks in most languages for these components. Some are available under extremely permissive licenses.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTesla provides a great illustration of this concept. Their first key differentiator was to use a lithium-ion battery to make electric cars competitive with gas. Lithium-ion achieved this by reducing battery weight and increasing range.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first Tesla prototype simply converted a pre-existing electric sports car from lead-acid to lithium batteries. Their first production run was mostly a Lotus Elise roadster (a pre-existing sports car) that had a Tesla battery and motor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe lesson for your team is to use what already exists wherever possible. If you can use or adapt a FOSS package, do it. Even if you need to license for-pay code from somewhere else, it’s almost always worth it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet all the scaffolding in place quickly so you can test your “lithium-ion battery.” Then you can iterate through and replace whatever will help further differentiate your product without stressing about delaying production-readiness.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe second checkpoint of your development process is to review the planned architecture with your team and identify what very limited part they intend to build from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf it sounds like something that already exists, and it’s not the core focus of your product, challenge your team to see why they believe they need to re-do it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t just throw it over the wall\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have identified what pre-built technologies you’ll use, make sure to review these with your production support group.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDatabase and server administrators will need to plan for installing and supporting any new technologies. This is the third checkpoint in your development process: operations readiness.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKeeping the production support team in the loop early is 90% of the secret sauce known as “DevOps.” If you haven’t heard of this, DevOps is the idea that software development and production operations teams should unify under common goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe proposed benefits include much quicker releases, more reliable code, and more time spent developing due to automation. These are all great boons, but they follow from a strong communication process. Automation follows, not replaces, collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eImplementation and Testing\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow your team writes the code. Collaborate with your implementation team to devise a process for dividing the work among themselves. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and this is where the “soft skills” of leadership dramatically outweigh any technical skill.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome developers will want to hog all the “interesting” work and ignore any drudge work. They may believe that they’re the smartest person in the room and should get their pick of assignments. Others may resist change and only want to do the same kind of work they’ve done before.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLead your team into an equitable distribution of work. Challenge everyone to grow appropriately and to share and collaborate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne more technical aspect of the implementation is that the code must include sufficient automated tests. These are code-defined tests that a test system can execute.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf the code’s going to crash, don’t you want these guys’ resumes to be on the line instead of your own? (public domain: US Government photo)\u003cbr /\u003e Manual “test scripts” where a human interacts with the code to see if it works are insufficient and reflect technical debt. Your technical team should at least include unit tests. Test-driven development is a popular approach for ensuring that critical code is always tested.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can drive a non-technical conversation with your team about their “test coverage” (the portion of the code that is tested). It’s pretty simple: ask them to list their assumptions. Then ask where and how they test these assumptions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe checkpoint at which the code is believed complete by the developers is referred to in my shop as dev-complete. It means the primary development (dev) process is over, but additional code may be written to address issues that come up in the review process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn an agile development process, you will typically divide the implementation process into multiple checkpoints instead of one all-or-nothing deadline. These are typically called iterations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRefer to the roadmap you defined in the first step. Before starting new component(s), ensure that what you’ve already started is at least dev-complete. This provides you with an accurate view of the speed of development and reduces risk.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you complete the iterations, you can push the code to an environment for “acceptance testing.” This involves pilot or test users (or an internal team playing that role) who interact with the partial product. They test to ensure it meets the design expectations and provide feedback on how it could be better.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAcceptance testing is not a substitute for the unit testing mentioned earlier. It serves a different purpose. Letting your development team lean on acceptance testing to catch basic functional bugs is a recipe for disaster.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFeedback from the acceptance testers can be incorporated into the next iteration. This is another good reason not to bite off a big chunk of the product all at once. You want to leave room to change course once people start playing with the product.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve accumulated enough tested code to constitute a sufficient product release, you’re ready to begin the release management process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLooking for bugs in all the right places\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour developer or team has reached a point where they believe the code is done. Acceptance testers are satisfied with the way the product is working. The next checkpoint in the process is to validate the belief that you have code ready to become a product. Let’s start reviewing the code!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may not be comfortable or have sufficient technical know-how to review the team’s code yourself. That’s ok! You don’t have to. Your process has to.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWork with your team to identify a process for code review that works for them. If you have more than one developer, peer code review works great. If you don’t, are there other developers in your organization outside of your team? Work across team boundaries to establish a peer code review program.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf there really is only one developer, then sit down with them and have them walk you through the code. Use your schematics as a reference point, and ask them to tell you how the code accomplishes the schematic’s goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the conclusion of the code review process, the developer and reviewer(s) should feel comfortable with being held accountable for the code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe code review is also a good time for reviewing two other critical points: documentation and security.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve already written about a sustainable documentation architecture — check it out if you’re interested!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSecurity review should be a part of any code review. In general, this involves taking a second look at the code to spot weaknesses where an attacker could exploit it to reveal private data or gain control of the server. It must be done by a technical person.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a free comprehensive guide to security review.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour developer can do this if they’re the only one on the team, even if they just run an automated security code analysis tool. There are free tools for helping with this process which are linked through the OWASP wiki.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEject, eject, eject!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe code has passed the review process. It’s ready to become a product. But that doesn’t mean it’s ready for production.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe last checkpoint to clear is deployment readiness. Is your code in a state where it’s easy to deploy to production? This should involve as few manual steps as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt also means you need to have a plan for reverting the change in case the code doesn’t work as planned. This is called a “rollback plan.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e If you have a separate software operations team, this is where they come back into the picture. They should review the deployment and rollback documentation and let you know if it’s sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have these personnel you can perform this step yourself. Make sure that there are clear, simple instructions for deploying the product. There should be very few manual steps, as each manual step introduces a chance for human error.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere should be a clear, sufficient plan for returning to the prior state of affairs if the deployment doesn’t succeed. This may be as simple as restoring a backup, or it may involve customer communication or data conversion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhether the plan is sufficient depends on how thoroughly your team tested the code, and how widely the product is being released. Consider also any risks associated with the product or with this particular release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve passed this checkpoint, push that code into production!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePost-release\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSucceed or fail, it’s important to circle back and review how the process went.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDid your team accurately estimate the effort required to release a product? Did the testing adequately model the production scenario? Revisit the implementation and testing checkpoints, and review how well the team performed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow is the product running in production? It’s a good idea to visit the operations staff and obtain their feedback. This further creates trust between the development and operations teams, and will lead to more DevOps benefits down the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhere are the remaining gaps in your product? If they’re in third-party code, now’s the time to consider whether to customize your packages or re-implement from scratch. Otherwise, you now have input on what to build for the next release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAbove all, hold yourself and your team accountable for the results of your effort.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccountability facilitates independence and promotes individual growth. As your team grows accustomed to being held accountable for each step in this process, they’ll adjust their performance accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to be the least bit technical to run a successful software release process. Technical skill can help, but it can also become a crutch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe key to successful software release is a well-documented, well-understood process for moving software through the pipeline from idea to product. You now have a starting point for drafting your own software release process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat’s most important is that you participate with your team in filling in the blanks and creating a repeatable process that works for all of you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t have to be perfect for anyone, but it does have to be understood by everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou also need to ensure that the velocity of your product through these checkpoints matches the demand for the product. None of these items need to be multi-day show-stoppers. It could be a simple one-page checklist. You need to define a process that fits your environment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs with any process, you should also iterate. Just like with the code, your first, untested draft isn’t likely to be perfect. Tune the process on each run-through and you’ll end up with a smooth, predictable software release path.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd remember to brush your hair. You don’t want it looking…pointy.\u003c/p\u003e",

I more loosely regard as legacy any code which contains more technical debt than the time it took to write.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs our organization had, many development teams fall into the trap of instant-legacy code: code that already fits the “legacy code” label at the time of release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn my experience, documentation is the most important aspect of avoiding such legacy code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have yet to meet a developer who loves the idea of documentation. On the other hand, I also have never met a developer who loves crawling inside the skull of a stranger to reverse-engineer a legacy implementation without any documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs they say, breaking up is hard to do. But in this case, I promise it will be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo let’s get started on converting your legacy into something you’ll be proud to bequeath to your successors. Let’s get documenting!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur approach: four layers of documentation\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe created, and began rigorously following, a four-layer architecture for documentation. We maintain three layers of persistent documentation for the project through its life-cycle. We also communicate through one layer of ephemeral documentation during our release management process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe three persistent layers of documentation correlate to three different velocities in our development process. We include documentation review as part of code review to avoid falling back into bad habits.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e// The front lines: in-line comments keep maintainers sane\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe most granular tier of explicit documentation is in the code. We perform complete documentation of all classes and methods, their inputs, expected outputs, and exception pathways. We also document “unusual” code in-line.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a predominantly C# shop we use /// documentation ubiquitously. This decorates class, interface, and method declarations. The /// helper auto-generates XML stubs to document the nuts and bolts of the API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese pop up when your code is being referenced by an external project or DLL (dynamic-link library), provided that you’ve distributed the debugging files. Our IDE (integrated development environment) renders this as tool-tip help wherever a reference appears. This greatly aids developers, who are diving into our code for the first time, when trying to fix a bug or extend it for a new use case.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s worth researching your language and IDE of choice to learn how to extend it with contextual help for your libraries. If you’re not used to documenting your APIs, I suggest reading these articles to get started.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also include regular // comments beyond API documentation. We add these wherever the code is counter-intuitive, or if we’ve found a particularly elegant solution to a problem. We also use these to create “to-do’s” for later refactor when putting in a quick-and-dirty fix.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are invaluable to whoever has to come along and revert the change or fix the code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause it’s in-line with the source code, this documentation changes at the highest velocity — right along with the code it supports.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eREADME: making implementation a breeze\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use README files as an implementer’s guide. This documentation is for whoever will be consuming our libraries. It serves a secondary purpose as tactical-level documentation of the particulars of the implementation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use GitHub for source control, so we place readme.md (Markdown) files in each folder in our GitHub repository. GitHub very nicely renders Markdown files and automatically shows the rendered readme.md files in each folder. This results in a much more usable help file than a simple .txt document.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStoring this documentation in the code-base helps developers maintain the documentation. Anyone making a code change can easily open the .MD file in their source code editor or an online markdown editor, and immediately update the documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThus the source-controlled Markdown files live next to, but not within, the code they support. It’s also somewhat more “zoomed out” than inline comments. These two factors result in a lower velocity of updates on this documentation. Because you can still include it in the same commits it changes with higher velocity than offline documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe final advantage of this format is that anyone who downloads the source code has immediate access to the implementation guides. Coupled with the inline documentation, this provides both maintainers and consumers with sufficient documentation. They can develop a basic understanding of the project without jumping into another system, such as a wiki.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWiki: where business meets development\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use the wiki-level documentation to marry the implementation to the business requirements. This documentation consists primarily of requirements, enterprise architecture diagrams and considerations, and tactical diagrams such as unified modeling language (UML) flow charts and class diagrams.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also use pages (on the same wiki) as meeting minutes, and to record decisions. We use a wiki which has versioning so that we can see a complete history of how requirements and designs have changed over time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe thereby ensure a complete history of the requirements process and how it relates to the changing architecture. Incidentally, GitHub also provides a wiki feature, but we use a third-party wiki which integrates with our project management software.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRelease management: commit and pull request comments\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur release management process includes code review. Our code review includes documentation review.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs GitHub is our source control platform, we bake code review into our pull requests. The platform supports commenting upon check-in, inline comment threads on portions of commits, and a conversation thread on the pull request.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe key to using these communication channels successfully is to ensure that all discussions result in a tangible output. Either clarify the code itself, or extend the permanent documentation in response to questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf the reviewer doesn’t understand the code as it is written, future developers won’t either. Rewrite the code to be more self-explanatory, or extend the in-line or readme documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s not sufficient to end the conversation by replying to the thread: we treat this documentation as ephemeral, and on a long-lived code-base it’s a pain to review the full commit history.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBonus round: self-documenting code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, one quick plug for so-called “self-documenting code.” I’m a firm believer that the code should be self-explanatory at the surface. Explicit documentation should provide context or improve maintainability.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are already good articles about this (here’s one), so I won’t go into detail here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinal thoughts\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope that you learn from our experience. Our four-layer documentation architecture may not work for you, but it’s important to figure out what will.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe big take-aways? First, it’s necessary to develop a healthy understanding of yourself and your own needs before you entangle yourself with a new code base.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSecond, it’s easier to stay out of a bad relationship with legacy code than to extract yourself once you’re already committed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd third, you only leave one legacy. But every commit you make contributes to it. They won’t all be good, they won’t all be bad, but they should at least be clear. Please think about what you’re leaving for those who come after you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTogether we can reclaim our legacy as developers.\u003c/p\u003e",

If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, but still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students. It was intended to help level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe problem\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s the sad truth: given the state of college recruiting today, if you haven’t attended one of a very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same few schools every year. Despite the fact that the career fair is one of the most antiquated, biased forms of recruiting that there is, the format persists. This is likely because there doesn’t seem to be a better way to quickly connect with students at scale.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, despite the increasingly loud conversation about diversity, campus recruiting marches on, and companies keep doing the same thing expecting different results.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn a previous blog post, we explained why companies should stop courting students from the same five schools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRegardless of how important you think this idea is (for altruistic reasons, perhaps), you may still be skeptical about the value and practicality of broadening the college recruiting effort. You probably concede that it’s rational to visit top schools, given limited resources. Society is often willing to agree that there are perfectly qualified students coming out of non-top colleges, but they maintain that they’re relatively rare.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’re here to show you, with some nifty data from our university platform, that this is simply not true.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo be fair, this isn’t the first time we’ve looked at whether where you went to school matters. In a previous post, we found that taking Udacity and Coursera programming classes mattered way more than where you went to school. And way back in the day, one of our founders figured out that where you went to school didn’t matter at all — but that the number of typos and grammatical errors on your resume did.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, what’s different this time? The big, exciting difference is that these prior analyses were focused mostly on engineers who had been working for at least a few years already. This made it possible to argue that a few years of work experience smoothes out any performance disparity that comes from having attended (or not attended) a top school.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn fact, the good people at Google found that while GPA didn’t really matter after a few years of work, it did matter for college students. So, we wanted to face this question head-on and look specifically at college juniors and seniors while they were still in school. Even more pragmatically, we wanted to see if companies limiting their hiring efforts to just top schools were getting higher caliber candidates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore delving into the numbers, here’s a quick rundown of how our university platform works and what kind of data we collect.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe setup\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor students who want to practice on interviewing.io, the first step is a brief (~15-minute) coding assessment on Qualified to test basic programming competency. Students who pass this assessment (that is, those who are ready to code while another human being breathes down their necks) get to start booking practice interviews.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter during a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role. Interviewers typically come from top companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees in a few different categories, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is “poor” and 4 is “amazing!” On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was skilled enough to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn our platform, we’re fortunate to have thousands of students from all over the U.S., spanning over 200 universities. We thought this presented a unique opportunity to look at the relationship between school tier and interview performance for both juniors (interns) and seniors (new grads).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo study this relationship, we first split schools into the following four tiers, based on rankings from U.S. News \u0026 World Report:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Elite” schools (like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC-Berkeley)\u003cbr /\u003e Top 15 schools (not including top tier, like University of Wisconsin, Cornell, Columbia)\u003cbr /\u003e Top 50 schools (not including top 15, like Ohio State University, NYU, Arizona State University)\u003cbr /\u003e The rest (like Michigan State, Vanderbilt University, Northeastern University, UC-Santa Barbara)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, we ran some statistical significance testing on interview scores vs. school tier to see if school tier mattered for both interns (college juniors) and new grads (college seniors). Our sample comprised a set of roughly 1,000 students.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDoes school have anything to do with interview performance?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the graphs below, you can see technical score distributions for interviews with students in each of the four school tiers (see legend). As you recall from above, each interview is scored on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is the worst and 4 is the best.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat’s pretty startling is that the shape of these distributions, for both juniors and seniors, is remarkably similar. Indeed, statistical significance testing revealed no difference between students of any tier when it came to interview performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJust to note: of course, this hinges on everyone completing a quick 15-minute coding challenge first, to ensure they’re ready for synchronous technical interviews. We’re excited about this because companies can replicate this step in their process as well!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat this means is that top-tier students are achieving the same results as those in “no-name” schools. So the question becomes: if the students are comparable in skill, why are companies spending egregious amounts of money attracting only a subset of them?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOkay, so what are companies missing?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBesides missing out on great, cheaper-to-acquire future employees, companies are missing out on an opportunity to save time and money. Right now, a ridiculous amount of money is being spent on university recruiting. We’ve previously cited the $18k price tag just for entry to the MIT career fair. In a study done by Lauren Rivera through the Harvard Business Review, she reveals that one firm budgeted nearly 1 million dollars just for social recruiting events on a single campus.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe higher price tag of these events also means that it makes even less sense for smaller companies or startups to try and compete with high-profile, high-profit tech giants. Most of the top schools that are being heavily pursued already have enough recruiters vying for their students. Unwittingly, this pursuit seems to run contrary to most companies’ desire for high diversity and long-term sustainable growth.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven when companies do believe that talent is evenly distributed across school tiers, there are still reasons why companies might recruit at top schools. There are other factors that help elevate certain schools in a recruiter’s mind. There are long-standing company-school relationships (for example, the number of alumni who work at the company currently). There are signaling effects, too — companies get Silicon Valley bonus points by saying their eng team is comprised of a bunch of ex-Stanford, ex-MIT ex-and so on students.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA quick word about selection bias\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince this post appeared on Hacker News, there’s been some loud, legitimate discussion about how the pool of students on interviewing.io may not be representative of the population at large. Indeed we do have a self-selected pool of students who decided to practice interviewing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCertainly, all the blog posts we publish are subject to this (very valid) line of criticism, as is this post in particular.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs such, selection bias in our user pool might mean that 1) we’re getting only the worst students from top schools (because, presumably, the best ones don’t need the practice), or 2) we’re getting only the best/most motivated students from non-top schools — or both.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAny subset of these results is entirely possible, but there are few reasons why we believe that what we’ve published here might hold truth regardless.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, in our experience, regardless of their background or pedigree, everyone is scared of technical interviewing. Case in point: before we started working on interviewing.io, we didn’t really have a product yet. So before investing a lot of time and heartache into this questionable undertaking, we wanted to test the waters to see if interview practice was something engineers really wanted — and more so, who these engineers that wanted practice were.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, we put up a pretty mediocre landing page on Hacker News…and got something like 7,000 signups on the first day. Of these 7,000 signups, roughly 25% were senior (4+ years of experience) engineers from companies like Google and Facebook. Now, this isn’t to say that they’re necessarily the best engineers out there, but it does suggest that the engineers the market seems to value the most still needed our services.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnother data point comes from one of our founders. Every year, Aline does a guest lecture on job search preparedness for a technical communication course at MIT. This course is one way to fulfill the computer science major communication requirement, so enrollment tends to span the gamut of computer science students. Before every lecture, she sends out a survey asking students what their biggest pain points are in preparing for their job search. Every year, trepidation about technical interviewing is either at the top of the list of 2nd from the top.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd though this doesn’t directly address the issue of whether we’re only getting the “best of the worst or the worst of the best” (and I hope the above has convinced you there’s more to it than that), here’s the distribution of school tiers among our users. I expect it mirrors the kinds of distributions companies see in their student applicant pool as well:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo what can companies do?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCompanies may never stop recruiting at top-tier schools entirely. But they ought to at least include schools outside of that very small circle in the search for future employees.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe end result of the data is the same: for good engineers, the school they attended means a lot less than we think. The time and money that companies spend to compete for candidates within the same select few schools would be better spent creating opportunities that include everyone. They could also develop tools to vet students more fairly and efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you saw above, we used a 15-minute coding assessment to cull our inbound student flow, and just a short challenge leveled the playing field between students from all walks of life. At the very least, we’d recommend employers do the same thing in their process. But, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t suggest one other thing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt interviewing.io, we’ve proudly built a platform that grants the best-performing students access to top employers, no matter where they went to school or where they come from. Our university program, in particular, allows us to grant companies the privilege to reach an exponentially larger pool of students, for the same cost of attending one or two career fairs at top target schools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWant diverse, top talent without the chase? Sign up to be an employer on our university platform!\u003c/p\u003e",

First, let’s pull back and look at how the web itself works.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWWW and remote servers\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I think about the Web, I imagine a large network of connected servers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery page on the internet is stored somewhere on a remote server. A remote server is not so mystical after all — it’s just a part of a remotely located computer that is optimized to process requests.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo put things in perspective, you can spin up a server on your laptop capable of serving an entire website to the Web (in fact, a local server is what engineers use to develop websites before releasing them to the public).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you type www.facebook.com into your browser, a request goes out to Facebook’s remote server. Once your browser receives the response, it interprets the code and displays the page.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo the browser, also known as the client, Facebook’s server is an API. This means that every time you visit a page on the Web, you interact with some remote server’s API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAPIs as a way to serve your customers\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ve probably heard of companies packaging APIs as products. For example, Weather Underground sells access to its weather data API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eExample scenario: Your small business’s website has a form used to sign clients up for appointments. You want to give your clients the ability to automatically create a Google calendar event with the details for that appointment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAPI use: The idea is to have your website’s server talk directly to Google’s server with a request to create an event with the given details. Your server would then receive Google’s response, process it, and send back relevant information to the browser, such as a confirmation message to the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlternatively, your browser can often send an API request directly to Google’s server bypassing your server.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow is this Google Calendar’s API different from the API of any other remote server out there?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn technical terms, the difference is the format of the request and the response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo render the whole web page, your browser expects a response in HTML, which contains presentational code, while Google Calendar’s API call would just return the data — likely in a format like JSON.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf your website’s server is making the API request, then your website’s server is the client (similar to your browser being the client when you use it to navigate to a website).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom your users perspective, APIs allow them to complete the action without leaving your website.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost modern websites consume at least some third-party APIs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany problems already have a third-party solution, be it in the form of a library or service. It’s often just easier and more reliable to use an existing solution.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are commonly referred to as microservices.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo summarize, when a company offers an API to their customers, it just means that they’ve built a set of dedicated URLs that return pure data responses — meaning the responses won’t contain the kind of presentational overhead that you would expect in a graphical user interface like a website.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCan you make these requests with your browser? Often, yes. Since the actual HTTP transmission happens in text, your browser will always do the best it can to display the response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, you can access GitHub’s API directly with your browser without even needing an access token. Here’s the JSON response you get when you visit a GitHub user’s API route in your browser (https://api.github.com/users/petrgazarov).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe browser seems to have done just fine displaying a JSON response. A JSON response like this is ready for use in your code. It‘s easy to extract data from this text. Then you can do whatever you want with the data.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA is for “Application”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo close off, let’s throw in a couple more examples of APIs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Application” can refer to many things. Here are some of them in the context of API:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA piece of software with a distinct function.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe whole server, the whole app, or just a small part of an app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBasically any piece of software that can be distinctively separated from its environment, can be an “A” in API, and will probably also have some sort of API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say you’re using a third-party library in your code. Once incorporated into your code, a library becomes part of your overall app. Being a distinct piece of software, the library would likely have an API which allows it to interact with the rest of your code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s another example: In Object Oriented Design, code is organized into objects. Your application may have hundreds of objects defined that can interact with one another.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEach object has an API — a set of public methods and properties that it uses to interact with other objects in your application.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn object may also have inner logic that is private, meaning that it’s hidden from the outside scope (and not an API).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom what we have covered, I hope you take away the broader meaning of API as well as the more common uses of the term today.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

Add in a full-time job and a couple of kids and the task seems nearly impossible. Yet, even if you are busy, you can prioritize and make the time to focus on what matters to you and build the skills to level up your career.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEngineer your future with code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI started my coding journey just six months ago. Now I am one project away from completing my front-end developer certificate on freeCodeCamp. I’ve also completed the web developer boot camp course by Colt Steele on Udemy. And I did this all while raising two kids and working in a full-time job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I began using these tips, I saw my progress increase tenfold. I know I would have accomplished much more if I had implemented them earlier in my journey. I have not only benefited from increased productivity, but I feel more balanced and am having more fun than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy pivot into web development\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter being in health care for the last five years, I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Don’t get me wrong - I loved helping people on their path to health, but I hated seeing the system break down for them. I hated when people could not afford their medication, or when their care plan wasn’t in sync with the treatment they needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wanted to do more to help these people. But I knew that I couldn’t do more unless I took a step back and looked at the bigger picture.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was not always interested in coding, but the more I looked at the forces making real change in today’s world, the more I saw that tech was behind these advances.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw an opportunity to make meaningful change, and that is when I became interested in coding.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy are you coding?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhatever the reason is, really think about it and pin it down. Use it as motivation to propel you towards your coding goals. Having this end goal will help you bust through plateaus and push through the hard parts (coding is hard).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery day that I spend at my current day job motivates me to get home, boot up my laptop, and continue my journey of learning how to code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe good news is that building coding skills is simple. All you have to do is code a lot. But unfortunately, this is where the hard part comes in. Fitting time into your busy life to routinely code is difficult, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to climb the coding mountain\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a gap between where you are now and where you want to be. That is why you are reading this article. That is why you work day in and out, and end up sacrificing time with your family and loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf we are spending all this time working towards our goal, it is paramount to make the most of the time we spend learning how to code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are five steps to turn this dream into a reality:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCreate your personalized goals\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo make the most of your time, nothing is more important than making actionable short-term goals. This will not only help you feel a sense of accomplishment every time you meet a goal, but it will help make the coding journey feel a lot less daunting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoals Exercise!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you come up with focused goals, I want to encourage you to do a quick exercise that I picked up from Laura Vanderkam.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Picture yourself one year from now. You have crushed ALL your coding goals and landed your dream job. You have given five talks at conferences around the world, and you built up your App and it was successful. Whatever success looks like to you, picture your future self. Please be ambitious, maybe even dream a little.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. What 3 - 5 goals did you accomplish in that year that made it so successful?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Write these goals down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Repeat this exercise for your personal life goals. It is impossible to work all the time, and to be successful you need work life balance (or you will burn out).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow you have 6 - 10 ambitious goals that you want to accomplish during the next year. To break these larger goals down into action items, think about and plan about how you can meet these goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, if you want to complete the freeCodeCamp front end certificate, you need to schedule time to work on it throughout the week. If you want to run a marathon, you need to buy running shoes, sign up for a marathon, and schedule time to train regularly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make a Schedule\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll be honest - I am definitely not the scheduling type. I thought that I could wing it day by day. But realistically, you need to set time aside to focus, or your goals will pour over into the rest of your life. I found myself feeling anxious about coding during time with my family or when I was putting my kids to bed, because I hadn’t coded yet that day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe thing I looked forward to all day (coding) started to negatively impact my quality of life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSplitting your time into focused blocks allows you to be 100% in the present moment. When it is coding time, you can have tunnel vision and hack away. When it is time to unwind, or hang out with people you care about, you can be present because you coded that morning, or have time scheduled later in the day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI schedule a lot of family time. Family is really important to me. Your schedule will look a lot different, but the point is to create a schedule that will allow you to meet your goals without you hating life along the way. Just try to account for everything, so you can stick to your schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Audit yourself to find time opportunities\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWrite down all the activities in a given day or week and see what you really do with your time. You will likely be surprised by exactly how much time you spend mindlessly scrolling through your Instagram feed, or binge watching a new Netflix show (I love Stranger Things).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m not telling you to cut all of it out but keep a balance. You can definitely turn some of that idle time into some serious coding gains.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is more time than you think\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you are still thinking to yourself, “yeah, but I still work a lot and (insert excuse here) so I can’t find time”, then here is a fun fact! There are 168 hours in a week. If you work a full 40 hour week and subtract 8 hours of sleep per night (which I definitely don’t get) you still end up with 72 hours of “free” time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLook at all the time you have in your life situation and squeeze as much “good” stuff into that time as you can. There IS time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Fill your time with quality\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Here are some tools that I use to help me accomplish my coding goals and stay focused on my learning path:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003efreeCodeCamp\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeriously one of the best tools for meeting goals. The curriculum is right there for you to follow and work on, it even tracks your progress!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJavaScript 30\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e30 JavaScript projects really help you master array methods while filling up your portfolio with projects (plus it is tons of fun). Wes Bos is a solid instructor who provides a quality free course. You can complete it in 30 consecutive days, or work it into your learning schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e100 Days of code on Twitter\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis 100 day challenge consists of coding every day and tweeting about what you did. It is a great tool for tracking progress and measuring how far you have come. This community is full of inspiring people from all over the world and is a great way to meet like minded developers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Web Developer Boot Camp\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI am almost finished with this course, and it has patched a lot of holes in my coding knowledge. Colt doesn’t just show you how to do something, he also explains why you do it a certain way. Plus, there is now an advanced web developer boot camp that I am going to take once I’m done.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLive It!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a resource, but you should embrace the tech community by living it. Listen to podcasts while you drive to work or do the dishes. Follow leaders in the industry on Twitter. Read articles. Immerse yourself in tech and you will learn without realizing you are learning.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Multiply your time\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe have set goals, and now have several larger goals broken down into actionable goals. We have gone through how to fit these goals into your busy life and I have helped give you some ideas on how to fill your time. Now, I want to tell you how you can make the most out of the time you put into coding.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Answer: Be Happy!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat does being happy have to do with managing time, you ask? Simply put: it is everything. The idea is called multiplying your time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBeing present and deeply focused leads to increased productivity. This in turn multiplies the time you spend by increasing efficiency. Plus, who doesn’t want to be happy?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to Shawn Achor, who studied the effects of happiness and its link to productivity, your brain performs 31% more productively when you feel happy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDopamine, which floods into your system when you feel positive, does two things:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt makes you happier (duh!)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt turns on the learning centers in your brain. They help you learn things more easily, and allow you to spend less time on learning while retaining more information.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTurn your brain into a dopamine producing machine!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can release more dopamine by creating lasting, positive change. There are five things you can work into your routine to turn your brain into a dopamine producing machine:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Write three new things that you’re grateful for each day. This creates the habit of scanning the world for positive things, instead of negative ones.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Journal about a positive experience you had in the last 24 hours. This allows you to relive the positive experience which leads to the same dopamine response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Exercise. Go on a short walk before a coding session, or bust out a quick workout. Exercise releases tons of dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Meditate. Meditation trains your brain to focus more on the task at hand, all while releasing dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Random acts of kindness. Thank someone in your social support network for helping you, or help someone out. This not only releases dopamine for you, it also does the same for the person you helped (and they may pay it forward).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse blocks of time to build your future\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven if we are busy, we must take out time for the things that matter the most. When you focus on what matters, you can build the life you want with the blocks of time you have.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

I’ve spent thousands of hours reading books, writing code, and watching computer science lectures, all to prepare for the Google software engineer interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow I Got Here\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI started programming in middle school, but when it came time for college I pursued a degree in Economics. My rationale was that there would be too many programmers looking for jobs by the time I graduated. Boy, I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, I joined the Army to become a programmer, but the recruiter talked me into a military intelligence position, and I spent the next two years studying the Korean language. I served in South Korea for 2 years afterward.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore I left the Army, I attempted to get back into programming and was surprised at the difficulty. I had learned BASIC in middle school and kept programming it through high school. But I restarted my programming studies with C++, and the leap was too large. I just couldn’t grasp it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI did enjoy making websites, however, but I used software with a Word-like interface that I used to publish my websites. I didn’t know how to make websites from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter the Army, I decided to stay in Korea for a year and teach English. I used my nights and weekends to study web programming, using Perl, HTML, CSS (which was new at the time), JavaScript, and SQL.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter a year of intense study, I landed a job in the Seattle area, and I’ve been here ever since.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve been a web developer now for 15 years. I’ve started 3 companies, 2 of which are still running and generating revenue. I’ve worked at large and small companies, helped startups launch and grow, and recruited and managed teams. I’ve been a product manager, a CEO, a designer, and a marketer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve had a successful career and learned a lot along the way. But I’m not done yet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeeking a Career Change\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the part where I didn’t get a computer science degree? It has made a difference.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few years ago, I thought I could get hired anywhere. I thought I was hot stuff: the elusive full-stack web developer. But during my job search in 2013, I realized my skills were lacking. I had spent so much time chasing dollars by running startups in my spare time, that I had let my skills atrophy. I hadn’t kept up with technology.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor years, I had learned just enough to get by. I had a wide skill set but wasn’t an expert in anything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t get me wrong, I could still get hired, but not in the technologies or areas I wanted to work in. I could get hired for areas where the tech stack was somewhat outdated, like me. There’s big money in there, but I didn’t see exciting prospects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe realization reached its peak last year at a career fair. I was interested in perhaps working for one of the local companies that were startup labs run by venture capital firms. However, the fact that I lacked a computer science degree, and the skills and knowledge that accompany such a degree, meant I didn’t have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was working full-time on my businesses at the time, and still am today.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 2016, I decided it was time to make a career change from web developer to software engineer. I would need to study hard and practice in order to compress a computer science degree into a few months, but once I did, I could start a new career.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may not see web development and software engineering as different positions. Both involve programming and craftsmanship, but software engineering adds to it knowledge of data structures and algorithms, compiled languages, memory considerations, and understanding the impact of coding and architecture decisions on the machines where they reside.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLarge companies that hire for software engineering positions expect candidates to have this knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI reached out to an acquaintance who works at Google and asked him questions about his experience at the company. I had been reading How Google Works and was pretty familiar with Google already.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThrough another contact, I received a copy of Google’s coaching notes that are provided to interview candidates. This became the basis of my study plan.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle is a pretty awesome place to work, but before I even knew that, Google was my goal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy Google?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle sets a very high bar for hiring. They want to hire only the best. So if I set my sights high (getting hired at Google), I’ll still be quite hireable elsewhere even if I’m not selected.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe more I learn about Google, the more I want to work there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn brief, Google is a company that hires smart, creative people, and treats them well. Google rewards merit, encourages big ideas, and gives employees the freedom to make good decisions for the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe hiring process is calibrated to bring in smart, passionate people. Google has honed the recruitment and interview process over the years. The brain teaser questions are long gone. Nowadays candidates are chosen based on coding ability, technical knowledge, and Googleyness. There’s a lot going on in that one word.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eManagement is different. Managers don’t micro-manage. They trust engineers to make the right decisions. Trusting employees changes the role of managers at Google from what most folks envision when they think of management. In addition, managers can’t unilaterally, hire, fire, or promote. Many of the important management decisions that could be perceived as office politics are handled by a committee to remove that danger.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle’s people operations (HR) has learned what works over time, and they use data and employee feedback to improve evaluation systems, the hiring process, promotions, compensation, benefits, and more. Read Work Rules! by Laszlo Bock (SVP, People Operations) for more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes, the benefits are amazing. I went on a tour of the Google office in Kirkland, WA, and it surpassed my expectations. And my expectations were already high.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle Interview University\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the coaching notes I received telling me what to study? The list of topics seemed manageable, even though I didn’t know anything on the list.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI turned the topics on the notes into an outline and started filling in the topics with YouTube videos of lectures from MIT and UC Berkeley. A video on linked lists in one place, a video about queues in another. The list started to grow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI published the list on Github because my Github account was pretty empty. Since all the code I wrote for my businesses and work was private, my Github account made it look like I didn’t code at all. I needed to build up a portfolio. I originally called the project “Project 9894”. Google launched on Sept 4, 1998. Hence the name. I later renamed it to “Google Interview University”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver time I added some optional topics that I discovered along the way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was pretty amazed I had gotten so far in my career without even knowing how a CPU processed a program, how memory worked, or any of it. I had known “just enough” to be a success.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy little Github project started getting a few stars, and I published a blog post celebrating 20 stars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne morning, I awoke to find it had grown to 120 stars. Someone famous had tweeted about it during the night, and that led to it ending up on the Github daily trending report. I was #1 trending on Github for a few days.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany kind people reached out to thank and encourage me. It turns out there are thousands of people who want to not only work at Google but want to work as a software engineer, and this list was just the to-do list they needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s now at over 21,000 stars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI still can’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat If I Don’t Get the Job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt won’t be the end of the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve put the time and dedication into my studies for the goal of getting hired as a Google software engineer, but even if I fail, I’ll still be armed with the skills and knowledge required to work as a software engineer at any company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWherever I end up, I’m going in as an entry-level software engineer. I’m not going in with 15 years of software engineering experience because I simply don’t have it. When it comes to this stuff, I’m the equivalent of a fresh CS grad.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I have the enthusiasm of a new grad, too. This is a new world for me. I’m just getting started. I’m not afraid to make mistakes. I know I will. I also want to learn everything I can and be an excellent addition to any team.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t Study As Much As I Did\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes, I took 8 months. But I could have abbreviated the process. Like any startup with a big goal, you make mistakes and do things that waste time. There are many things I wish I go back and do differently.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI studied topics I didn’t need to, some because I thought I would need them for the interview, and some because I wanted to have the knowledge on hand for when I started working. I didn’t want to be a burden on the team I’m assigned to. It turns out I simply over-prepared.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent 3 weeks reading a 1,000-page book on C++. I don’t remember 1,000 pages worth, but I know a good bit about C++ now. As it turns out, I’m using Python for the interview, not C++. I had assumed I needed C++, C, or Java, but I was wrong. It’s good to ask, not assume.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI read way more books than I needed to. There are only 3 or 4 books I should have read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have a code catalog of dozens of algorithms that I review, most of which I wouldn’t expect in an interview. You don’t need to do that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI watched many hours of YouTube videos but could have watched far less, and spread out topics over time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI should have stopped reading books and watching videos earlier and started on coding problems sooner. I would have been able to spend more time applying the topics I learned.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpaced repetition is the key to memorization. Once you learn something, review it again later, and again even later. At each repetition, you reinforce your learning. Spending hours and hours at one time on priority queues won’t make you an expert. You become an expert by revisiting and reviewing over time. If you do so, you’ll get to the point where can’t forget details.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help review, I made 1,792 flashcards (digital flashcards). This is way too many. I review them on my phone or tablet whenever I get a spare moment (such as during Christmas shopping). Flash cards and spaced repetition go hand-in-hand. Once I get an answer on a flashcard right, I don’t mark it as known. I keep it in the deck and once I’ve seen it and answered it correctly many times, then I mark it as known.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy sense of fear (“What if they ask me a question about red-black trees?”) led me to study far more topics than I needed to.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I didn’t want to just prepare for the interview, I wanted to prepare for a career at Google, solving large-scale problems. That means knowing algorithms that will save computing resources of time, space, and I/O.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI may never need to know a maximum flow algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson), but it’s nice to know I have that tool available if the situation arises (without memorizing the implementation), and can recognize its application to a problem space.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEarly on, I wished I could skip all this learning, and just hurry up and get hired so I could instead spend my time learning the languages and tools for the team I join. But along the way, I realized how important this knowledge is, and even though most of it may not be applicable on a daily basis, I’m glad I put in the effort. I have a new appreciation of the history of computing, the greats in the field, data structures and algorithms (and how they complement each other), and how computer systems work at low-level.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll be putting in my application soon. It’s been a long journey getting to this point — almost an entire year. It began back in January, but I wasn’t able to commit to full-time study until April.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m about as prepared as I can be. I can’t keep studying and putting off the application forever. At some point, I have to take the leap.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI see a bright future ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, thank you to everyone who cheered me on and supported me with your kind words over the last few months. I appreciate all of you so much. Your encouragement helped me get back to the whiteboard every day and practice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy didn’t I get hired?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI don’t know why.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLast week I received a rejection email from the recruiter, and at first, I thought it was a mistake, and laughed it off. I checked in with my referral and he inquired into it and lobbied on my behalf, but in the end, it didn’t change the situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe thing that bothers me is that I didn’t even get a phone screen. I didn’t even talk to a recruiter over the phone. After all this work and enthusiasm, I didn’t even get a chance to prove myself.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve done a lot of speculation about the reason why, but I won’t do that here. It’s all just guessing, which accomplishes nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I still like Google. However, I don’t know if I’ll apply again in the future. I want to get hired and stay at a company for a long time. I don’t want to hop around. The company that ends up hiring me will get a loyal, hardworking, enthusiastic employee. There are a lot of places where I can strive for greatness and have that effort rewarded.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRespect your Recruiter\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRecruiters look at hundreds of resumes every day, and they are highly tuned to detecting quality candidates and rejecting those who don’t match up with their model. For some reason, I just didn’t fit the profile. They probably are doing me a favor. It’s possible that I would have been in over my head and continually dragged my team down. Google is known for having false negatives in their selection process, but if you’re good enough for Google, you’ll eventually get in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRecruiters know what works, and what doesn’t. So respect their decision and be polite. I’ll bet they deal with irate rejected candidates on a daily basis, so don’t be like that. Just get more experience and knowledge and try again later.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you may know, the last 11 months have been very difficult for me. As a self-taught web developer of 15 years, my computer science study plan took me months to get through, and the main motivator was to start a new career as a software engineer, tackling large problems at a large tech company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle was the company I had audaciously set my sights on, but in the end that turned into disappointment. If you haven’t read about my story, you’re missing out. Go ahead and read it first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, I reached out to my network, and made a lot of new friends. I got connected with every tech giant in the Pacific northwest. Of all of them, Amazon had always stood out — even more than Google — as the most innovative company over the last 10 years. I applied via a referral, whom I had met at a startup event in 2013, and got the process rolling.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter so many months of non-stop effort, sacrifice, and worry, I’m pleased to announce that I finally made it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eToday I accepted an offer to be a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode, Alex, a Romanian developer, tells the tale of how he and his friends grew their small side project into a $17,000 a month business. In the beginning, they were coding in a Starbucks. Now their team has grown, they've sponsored 20 hackathons around the world, and business is booming. Here's their story.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten by Alexandru Paduraru: \u003ca href= \"http://twitter.com/axelut\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/axelut\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead by Quincy Larson: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/ossia\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ossia\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2F5yfQX\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2F5yfQX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript: \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 2014, my friends and I set out to build the best possible web design tools. We built UI kits, Admin Dashboards, Templates, and Plugins. We’ve always tried to create products that are helpful in the development process, and that we ourselves would use for building websites for clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom a revenue’s perspective, if we don’t take into consideration the Black Friday sales (which doubled the amount that we made in November 2016), we are grossing around $22,000 per month. Part of that goes toward paying our affiliates’ commissions, collected VAT, payment vendors’ taxes, and other expenses. We end up netting around $17,000 each month.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn this case study, I’ll share exactly how we built our products and grew our business. You’ll hear all about:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat motivated us to start our startup, Creative Tim, and how we built our initial product\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow we got our first users\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMarketing strategies we used to grow\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow our business model works\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe story behind our revenue sources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBiggest lessons we’ve learned so far\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. What motivated us to get started with Creative Tim and how we built the initial product\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe started out as a two-person agency in Romania with no funding from third parties. We didn’t have enough cash to rent an office — even desks at a co-working space —so we just worked out of a Starbucks. We were barely able to pay our daily living expenses by doing work for clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCreative Tim was a side project that we thought would come in handy to web developers like ourselves. We noticed that we were always “reinventing the wheel” when working with clients, and creating the same items over and over again for their websites. So we wanted to create a few standard components, like login and register modals, calendars, wizards, headers, and footers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver the span of a few months, we dedicated our time to implementing the platform and a few freebies (alongside the agency work). In the beginning, we didn’t have any Twitter followers, Facebook fans, or email list subscribers. We posted a lot of stuff about our freebies on various design forums and we used the “stalk web developers on Twitter” technique to spread the word about our products.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How we got our first users\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt first, nobody really understood what we wanted to do. They didn’t understand the value we could provide by helping them improve their businesses. We decided that it would be better to create a more complex product that would help people understand what we were doing 🤔\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe launched the Get Shit Done Kit, a UI Kit based on Bootstrap. It was featured on Designer News, and it was quite popular. We got over 11,000 users from that source, which was a huge spike for our business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen two weeks later our startup was featured on Product Hunt. That gave us another spike with over 5,000 users. After that, the situation was stable, and we graduated from 0 users/week to a consistent 2,000 to 3,000 users/week.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA couple of months later, motivated by the success of free Get Shit Done Kit, we released Get Shit Done Kit PRO the premium version of GSDK, with more components and ready-to-use example pages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInitially, we only made a few sales. The product was generating about $200/week, which was not nearly enough to sustain our business. At the same time we were working on a web project for one of our clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen in December, we got published on Bootstrap Expo, the most popular gallery for showcasing websites created with Bootstrap. This was another important spike for our business. Since all of the people who go to Bootstrap Expo for inspiration already know Bootstrap or have previously worked with it, they were the perfect audience for our business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, we discovered that getting traffic on your website is not enough to create a long term relationship with your users, and most of them forgot all about us after their first interaction. We did some research and discovered what most marketers probably already know: people forget things that they aren’t reminded of. Then we implemented the “Remember us email system” following the rules from the forgetting curve.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe wanted to give our users a reminder that we still existed and that we’re a valuable resource for their projects or their clients’ projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCurrently, we send emails at the following schedule:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter 3 days from their first download, we send an email with other recommended products.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 10 we send an email requesting feedback and asking if they need help.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 15 we remind them that they can upgrade to PRO.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 30 we ask them again for feedback and offer to promote something they’ve built in our gallery and social media.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe send a final reminder on day 60.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Marketing strategies we used to grow\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost of our marketing strategies consisted of submitting our content to different communities like Reddit, Product Hunt, Designer News, Hacker News, and GitHub. Some important subreddits that work well in our area include /r/web_design, /r/html5, /r/frontend, and /r/webdev.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also paid between $100–200 for newsletter campaigns a couple of times. Even though the ROI ratio matched the amount we invested, the campaigns did not meet the expectations. (Maybe this was just in our case, that wasn’t profitable and it works better for others.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen we paid $400 for Get Shit Done Kit PRO to appear in the Sidebar.io newsletter, a curated list of the 5 best design links made by Sacha Greif. This was a very rewarding newsletter for us, generating about $1,500 in sales.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen we purchased the “Review + Newsletter” package ($550) from eWebDesign. There were about 5,000 users who participated in the giveaway, and the total sales amounted $2,800.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also thought about different places where we could find web developers who could use our products, and we realized that hackathons were exactly what we needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePresenting how our tools can help during the Hackathon\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSubsequently we started talking to people that were organizing hackathons to offer them free licenses for our “premium products.” We sponsored over 20 hackathons in different cities around the world (you can check them here).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the developers were happy to get free licenses, which made us happy that we could help them create better projects faster and they also found out who we are, so a win-win situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCritically, being physically present at some of the hackathons also gave us a lot of information about how the developers were using our products and how we could improve them in order to make them more user-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn March 2015, we finished the agency’s contracts and we switched from “Agency mode” to “Startup mode.” With some revenue in the bank and a few monthly sales, our team moved to working full time for our startup. As we put everything together and constantly launched new products, our sources of traffic and revenue grew.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. How the business model works\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe realized that the best business model for Creative Tim was freemium: we create high quality freebies that help web developers build great websites, then release the PRO versions for those freebies, which contain more elements, sections, plugins, and example pages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this moment, we have 8 premium products, each of which have their own freebies. Their prices range from $19 to $599, depending on the license and archive type (HTML, HTML + PSD, HTML + Sketch). The freebies appear everywhere on different communities, blog posts, newsletters, and social websites — and they are driving all of our traffic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur business model: create high quality freebies that help web developers build great websites, then release the PRO versions for those freebies which contain more elements. 👌🏼\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe basic idea is that those freebies are always appearing on top 10 lists in these big communities. Each post that’s in the top 10 (depending on how big is the community) gives us between 1,000 and 15,000 targeted users in one day. You can imagine how much that would cost if you wanted to do a regular targeted marketing campaign. 😮\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome examples:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePaper Kit — 380 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 560 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLight Bootstrap Dashboard Angular — 210 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 180 uvpotes on Hacker News (peak position 9 with over 14,000 users coming to our website in 1 day)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 860 upvotes on Product Hunt\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eetc… you got the idea\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. The story behind our revenue sources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDirect Product Sales\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere we have the regular sales that are done on our website, which are worth about 24% of our overall sales. This doesn’t include the Big Bundle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is this Big Bundle, and how did we create it? We noticed that some of our users were downloading all our free products. (When I say all, I literally mean all of them in about 2–3 minutes after they have created an account.) We also noticed that some of our clients were purchasing all the products that were premium.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo we decided to test a new product called the “Big Bundle” which gives you access to all our products with huge discounts (over 60%). This big package was getting around 6–8 purchases per month. Since the prices for this Big Bundle is $299 (instead of $500) for the personal license and $669 (instead of $2,127) for the developer license, it’s a good source of revenue and a great deal for the web designers and agencies who are using our products for multiple clients. It’s a win-win situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAffiliates Sales\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’ve created an affiliate network, and our affiliates are very happy because they get 50% to themselves from each transaction. For example, one of our most important affiliations is done through a very popular GitHub Repo: Bootstrap Material Design (17,000+ stars on GitHub). Currently, affiliates account for around 25% of our overall revenue.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOrganic Search (SEO)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe saw that we were also getting around 22% of our revenue from SEO. So we decided to invest more in SEO, we brought on an SEO consultant, whom we pay around $500/month to improve our products’ ranks in Google.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOther revenue\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe remainder of our monthly revenue comes from Facebook, Twitter, and our newsletter. Here’s how our revenue has evolved over time, along with some historically important moments, so you can understand why it has grown in some months:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. The biggest lessons we’ve learned so far\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt sounds cliché, but having a great product is crucial.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA lot of founders really struggle trying to market and sell something that people don’t want or don’t need. If your product is crap, there is no marketing strategy — and no source of investment — that can keep it alive for long.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the moment, our products are used by over 134,000 web developers around the world. We have people from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Vodafone, Orange, Harvard University, Stanford University, and governmental institutions downloading and using them as different internal tools, and we’ve sponsored more than 20 global hackathons from 14 countries.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t look to be the next Facebook. Try to solve a real problem instead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery step in our development seemed like the natural thing to do at the time. Looking back at our evolution, we wouldn’t change anything. But with all we’ve learned, we could definitely do everything faster the second time around.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’ve always created and improved our products based on our customers’ feedback, and that is the best way to develop a business. It doesn’t matter what you personally like — you need to make sure you solve a real problem for a real customer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead, read, read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the past three years, I’ve read more than I’d read in my entire life, and this makes me feel great. Here are some of my favorite books, which I recommend to everybody:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to Win Friends and Influence People — Dale Carnegie\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eZero to One — Peter Thiel\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Hard Thing About Hard Things — Ben Horowitz\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLaw of Success — Napoleon Hill\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThink and Grow Rich — Napoleon Hill\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGood to Great — Jim Collins\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Lean Startup — Eric Ries\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Charisma Myth — Olivia Fox Cabane\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster — Alistair Croll\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI really do think that the secret weapon is to deliver great products combined with a great user experience and a great customer support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe best decision that we made was to put our customer in the first row, and make sure that they were receiving a great UI kit/Dashboard that really solved their problems. That guided us through the whole journey. Our secret weapon is that we deliver great products combined with a great user experience and great customer support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEverything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe are living in a world where anybody can become anything they want as long as they want to invest the amount of time that is needed. I’m saying time, and not money, because we all have time. I want to recommend two books that talk about this: Karaoke Capitalism by Jonas Ridderstråle and Kjell Nordstrom, and Zero to One by Peter Thiel (a PayPal co-founder).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this point, there are no limits. You can go anywhere on the planet and you can talk with whomever you want just by contacting them through social media. Today an ordinary person can achieve more influence than the president of a small country. Think of those Instagram accounts with millions of followers. If I — a regular guy from Romania — can build a profitable business in 2.5 years that is making 60x my country’s monthly minimum monthly wage, then boy, just about anything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e",

Today, I’m a 19 year old Android developer who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT startup. My name is Elvis Chidera and this is my story.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy journey began with my curiosity about how to build a website. Growing up, I spent a lot of time online as I loved downloading games and reading Society Of Robots. I would save for weeks to buy a 10 MB internet bundle for 100 Naira ($0.28), and back in 2012, that could last for a month.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen learning to code, I took the first and simple step of doing a Google search about how to build a website. I got millions of results. Not knowing where to start, I clicked on the first link I saw, which was from W3CSchools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe article explained that I need to learn some languages (HTML and CSS) to be able to build a website. I checked some other resources to confirm that I actually needed to learn these things. Then I started the W3CSchools HTML and CSS course.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEach day after school I would head over to the website to study. Initially, the code examples and explanations didn’t make much sense to me. But I kept studying regardless. I referred to various tutorials when I was stuck. This helped me view the problems I encountered from many different angles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I was younger, I struggled with my reading and writing skills in school. I was only able to get better at them through continuous practice. So I already had this model in my head: if I continue to practice — no matter how long it takes — I will ultimately be able to understand these programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few months of intensive learning got me acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I was still learning, a friend showed me the movie “The Social Network.” And after watching it, I was super motivated to build the next big thing. Thank you, Hollywood.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI had a eureka moment a few days later. The idea was to build a better version of Facebook. At that time, you couldn’t see your Facebook friends that were online. Also, Facebook was built to connect with people you already knew in real life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo that was my billion dollar startup idea: build a social network with all the features Facebook didn’t have. Mark Zuckerberg - I’m coming for you - or so I thought.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent the next few months building a better social network by adding any feature I could even think of using.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was naively confident that I was going to win.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter completing the project, I did what anybody without an advertising budget would do. I spammed the internet for days and days.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter several days of marketing, reality slapped me hard in the face. I only got 200 users, which I had to keep begging to come back to the site.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was depressed! A few months of hard work spent in vain. This taught me two important lessons the hard way:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI needed to recognize the cold start AKA chicken and egg problem that new platforms face early on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was building something I thought people needed. But I ended up building just another feature factory.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile it’s okay to be motivated by a project, you also need to know when you’re headed down a dead end. I spent a few more months trying to see if I could get more people on my site, but retention numbers kept dancing toward 0%, and I eventually gave up on the project.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I was motivated by the motto of Lewis in Meet the Robinsons, “Keep moving forward.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeeking inspiration for my next project, I reflected on the needs of my local community. This time around, I wanted to build something that people actually needed and are willing to pay for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI came up with an idea to make text messages cheaper and easier to send to multiple people at a time. This was more like Whatsapp backed by SMS. After speaking to different people about it, I decided this was the next thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI named the project Xmx Me. It was going to be a J2ME app. This meant I had to learn Java. Looking back in time, I have to admit that it was the biggest challenge I’d yet encountered. I had to read some tutorials several times to fully understand them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter completing a few Java courses, I was ready for work. Relentlessly typing one line of code after another, I carefully built the backend with PHP, the frontend with HTML and CSS, and the mobile app with J2ME. The app was coming to life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut here’s the thing — I didn’t own a laptop. I was building out all of these pieces of my app on my J2ME feature phone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWait. What?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou read that right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wrote my code on a Nokia 2690\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow I built my production apps on a feature phone\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this point in my life, I had never actually programmed on a laptop. I simply couldn’t afford one. My parents wanted to help me. But it was difficult for them because they had to choose between paying my school fees (and other necessities) versus buying me a laptop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hadn’t used a laptop before, and my only interaction with computers was at cyber cafes. I remember watching some videos about how to use a computer (left click, drag, drop, and other basic stuff) and then walking into a cyber cafe to practice them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was lucky that a relative had gifted me a feature phone (The Nokia 2690). This phone changed my life. It’s what I used to develop Xmx Me, my failed social network, and several other projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith nothing but a phone and the will to succeed, hour after hour I typed my code on that tiny keyboard. I was lucky again to have found an app that allowed me to compile my J2ME projects. Yes, building a J2ME app on a J2ME phone is possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe SDK was resource hungry, so my battery often died. I would carry on, writing out all my code on paper and try to review it for any syntax errors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI don’t think I’ll fail any Java whiteboard coding tests after having done this for so long. :)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLaunching my group SMS app\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter several months, I had the product ready. I was able to convince someone I met on an internet forum to help me pay for the website hosting and the bulk SMS service for a limited number of SMS units.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe app launch went well — at least better than my first project. We got some local press, and one of Kenya’s top blogs even wrote about the app. We grew organically to about 5,000 users.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe were in business. And we were getting transactions a couple of times a day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith no prior experience running a business, I made some huge mistakes, some of which were:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere was no easy way to charge users in Nigeria. Not everybody has a debit card. So I allowed people to pay using their mobile phone credit. The problem here was, there was no official way to convert this credit into money. I had to sell to vendors, who bought it back at a ridiculously low rates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere was little to no accounting. I was losing money and I didn’t know about it. I didn’t factor in some overhead costs. There were several missing pieces.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was considering selling the App to buy a laptop. Not knowing what to do, I went online to beg. Yes, I was that shameless and hungry. It didn’t turn out well. Somebody accused of being a scammer, which I eventually resolved. Again, I was inexperienced and I handled the situation poorly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter borrowing money multiple times to keep the business running, I decided to throw in the towel. Looking back, I think this was a bad decision. With a little more learning and experience, I would have been able to make things better. Maybe I didn’t see any future in an SMS app. Well, I released a throwback app recently, and many of the users still use it and love it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLessons I learned along the way\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI realized that if I was going to be able to afford a computer anytime soon, I would need to work hard for it. So I began saving all the money I could. I cut my daily expenses and lived as simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStill, it wasn’t enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job of building a website so I could earn the remaining sum.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow do you use a feature phone to build a website designed for PC users? Simple: have a Facebook friend who you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was cheaper than going to a cyber cafe repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also made heavy use of Ideone which allowed me to run my PHP scripts to see if they work before uploading them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, I finally was able to get that laptop. I can still remember the feeling of joy I had. That smell of plastic when you unbox a brand new cheap computer. I could now work on any project I wanted without feeling restricted because of my phone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince J2ME devices were slowly dying out, I eventually switched to building for the Android platform. My Java skills were still relevant there. I just needed to learn some platform-specific things.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe next year in 2015, after high school, I decided to start working to support my family. So I began freelancing. I was always active in local forums and groups, looking for people who wanted help with building an Android app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause I didn’t have a good portfolio, I would build apps for some people before they even paid, without any guarantee that I’d be paid. I was stung by this approach several times, but it allowed me to build a good enough portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI would like to share something I wish I knew while I was freelancing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t spread yourself too thin. Taking up too many responsibilities is not good for your health, your family, or the clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI worked with several clients from different parts of Nigeria who loved my work. I eventually got a full-time job in Lagos, Nigeria after working with a client remotely.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, while going through my news feed, I saw a job advert for an Android developer position at Dot Learn. I looked them up and realized they are an MIT startup working in an education technology field that I was passionate about, and in a market I understood. They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by making educational videos that are extremely data-light — as low as 1MB for every hour of video.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis was almost unbelievable, and I knew it was key to making education very accessible to a lot of people.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI am very passionate about revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I have already built a free (ad-supported) exam prep app called PrepUp that has over 30,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the West Africa Mobile Awards in 2016. So I wanted to be part of what Dot Learn was building.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo I went through the developer job requirements and I felt I had a chance. But impostor syndrome didn’t want me to be great.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor days I had conflicting thoughts. Should I apply or not?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen I realized one thing: I had nothing to lose.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe worst that could happen would be that I got rejected. But I wouldn’t die. So, I went ahead and applied.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFingers crossed, I started re-watching several of the videos I had downloaded from MIT OCW. I also spent some nights watching some coding interview solution videos. In the past, I had mostly been hired based on my strong portfolio and previous job experience, but I didn’t want to be caught off guard if they gave me a coding interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, long story short: after lots of preparation, answering some difficult questions, a phone interview, and some coding projects, I was accepted.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe it. I was ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLooking back at it, this was one of my best decisions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWorking at Dotlearn, I have had exponential growth in my career and have met with lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom attending big events like the Techcrunch Battlefield (I ended up missing my flight) to realizing I could rap, it’s been a fun and exciting experience so far.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eAn Australian developer thought his local police force was spending way too much money on their new license plate scanning system. So he decided to build one himself. Here's how he did this, and how he ended up catching a criminal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten and read by Tait Brown: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/taitems\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/taitems\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2iJWWuE\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2iJWWuE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Victoria Police are the primary law enforcement agency of Victoria, Australia. With over 16,000 vehicles stolen in Victoria this past year — at a cost of about $170 million — the police department is experimenting with a variety of technology-driven solutions to crackdown on car theft. They call this system BlueNet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help prevent fraudulent sales of stolen vehicles, there is already a VicRoads web-based service for checking the status of vehicle registrations. The department has also invested in a stationary license plate scanner — a fixed tripod camera which scans passing traffic to automatically identify stolen vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t ask me why, but one afternoon I had the desire to prototype a vehicle-mounted license plate scanner that would automatically notify you if a vehicle had been stolen or was unregistered. Understanding that these individual components existed, I wondered how difficult it would be to wire them together.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut it was after a bit of googling that I discovered the Victoria Police had recently undergone a trial of a similar device, and the estimated cost of roll out was somewhere in the vicinity of $86,000,000. One astute commenter pointed out that the $86M cost to fit out 220 vehicles comes in at a rather thirsty $390,909 per vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSurely we can do a bit better than that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Success Criteria\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore getting started, I outlined a few key requirements for product design.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #1: The image processing must be performed locally\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStreaming live video to a central processing warehouse seemed the least efficient approach to solving this problem. Besides the whopping bill for data traffic, you’re also introducing network latency into a process which may already be quite slow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough a centralized machine learning algorithm is only going to get more accurate over time, I wanted to learn if an local on-device implementation would be “good enough”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #2: It must work with low quality images\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince I don’t have a Raspberry Pi camera or USB webcam, so I’ll be using dashcam footage — it’s readily available and an ideal source of sample data. As an added bonus, dashcam video represents the overall quality of footage you’d expect from vehicle mounted cameras.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #3: It needs to be built using open source technology\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRelying upon a proprietary software means you’ll get stung every time you request a change or enhancement — and the stinging will continue for every request made thereafter. Using open source technology is a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy solution\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt a high level, my solution takes an image from a dashcam video, pumps it through an open source license plate recognition system installed locally on the device, queries the registration check service, and then returns the results for display.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe data returned to the device installed in the law enforcement vehicle includes the vehicle’s make and model (which it only uses to verify whether the plates have been stolen), the registration status, and any notifications of the vehicle being reported stolen.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf that sounds rather simple, it’s because it really is. For example, the image processing can all be handled by the openalpr library.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is really all that’s involved to recognize the characters on a license plate:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Minor Caveat\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePublic access to the VicRoads APIs is not available, so license plate checks occur via web scraping for this prototype. While generally frowned upon — this is a proof of concept and I’m not slamming anyone’s servers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eResults\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI must say I was pleasantly surprised.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI expected the open source license plate recognition to be pretty rubbish. Additionally, the image recognition algorithms are probably not optimised for Australian license plates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe solution was able to recognise license plates in a wide field of view.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnnotations added for effect. Number plate identified despite reflections and lens distortion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough, the solution would occasionally have issues with particular letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few frames later, the M is correctly identified and at a higher confidence rating.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you can see in the above two images, processing the image a couple of frames later jumped from a confidence rating of 87% to a hair over 91%.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m confident, pardon the pun, that the accuracy could be improved by increasing the sample rate, and then sorting by the highest confidence rating. Alternatively a threshold could be set that only accepts a confidence of greater than 90% before going on to validate the registration number.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThose are very straight forward code-first fixes, and don’t preclude the training of the license plate recognition software with a local data set.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe $86,000,000 Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo be fair, I have absolutely no clue what the $86M figure includes — nor can I speak to the accuracy of my open source tool with no localized training vs. the pilot BlueNet system.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI would expect part of that budget includes the replacement of several legacy databases and software applications to support the high frequency, low latency querying of license plates several times per second, per vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the cost of ~$391k per vehicle seems pretty rich — especially if the BlueNet isn’t particularly accurate and there are no large scale IT projects to decommission or upgrade dependent systems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFuture Applications\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile it’s easy to get caught up in the Orwellian nature of an “always on” network of license plate snitchers, there are many positive applications of this technology. Imagine a passive system scanning fellow motorists for an abductors car that automatically alerts authorities and family members to their current location and direction.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTeslas vehicles are already brimming with cameras and sensors with the ability to receive OTA updates — imagine turning these into a fleet of virtual good samaritans. Ubers and Lyft drivers could also be outfitted with these devices to dramatically increase the coverage area.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUsing open source technology and existing components, it seems possible to offer a solution that provides a much higher rate of return — for an investment much less than $86M.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the $86 million license plate scanner I replicated? I caught someone with it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few weeks ago, I published what I thought at the time was a fairly innocuous article: How I replicated an $86 million project in 57 lines of code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll admit — it was a rather click-bait claim. I was essentially saying that I’d reproduced the same license plate scanning and validating technology that the police in Victoria, Australia had just paid $86 million for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince then, the reactions have been overwhelming. My article received over 100,000 hits in the first day, and at last glance sits somewhere around 450,000. I’ve been invited to speak on local radio talk shows and at a conference in California. I think someone may have misread Victoria, AU as Victoria, BC.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough I politely declined these offers, I have met for coffee with various local developers and big name firms alike. It’s been incredibly exciting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost readers saw it for what it was: a proof of concept to spark discussion about the use of open source technology, government spending, and one man’s desire to build cool stuff from his couch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePedants have pointed out the lack of training, support, and usual enterprise IT cost padders, but it’s not worth anyone’s time exploring these. I’d rather spend this post looking at my results and how others can go about shoring up their own accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore we get too deep into the results, I’d like to go over one thing that I feel was lost in the original post. The concept for this project started completely separate from the $86 million BlueNet project. It was by no means an attempt to knock it off.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt started with the nagging thought that since OpenCV exists and the VicRoads website has license plate checks, there must be a way to combine the two or use something better.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt was only when I began my write-up that I stumbled upon BlueNet. While discovering BlueNet and its price tag gave me a great editorial angle, with the code already written. There were bound to be some inconsistencies between the projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also believe part of the reason this blew up was the convenient timing of a report on wasteful government IT spending in Australia. The Federal Government’s IT bill has shot up from $5.9 billion to $10 billion, and it delivered dubious value for that blow out. Media researchers who contacted me were quick to link the two, but this is not something I am quick to encourage.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Disclaimer\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the spirit of transparency, I must declare something that was also missing from the original post. My previous employer delivered smaller (less than $1 million) IT projects for Victoria Police and other state bodies. As a result, I’ve undergone police checks and completed the forms required to become a VicPol contractor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis may imply I have an axe to grind or have some specific insider knowledge, but instead I am proud of the projects we delivered. They were both on time and on budget.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVisualizing the Results\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe following is a video representation of my results, composited in After Effects for a bit of fun. I recorded various test footage, and this was the most successful clip.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI will go into detail about ideal camera setups, detection regions, and more after the video. It will help you better understand what made this iPhone video I took from through the windscreen a better video than a Contour HD angled out the side window.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn Ethical Dilemma\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you saw the hero graphic of this article or watched the video above, you may have noticed a very interesting development: I caught someone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I caught someone driving a vehicle with a canceled registration from 2016. This could have happened for many reasons, the most innocent of which is a dodgy resale practice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOccasionally, when the private sale of a vehicle is not done by the book, the buyer and seller may not complete an official transfer of registration. This saves the buyer hundreds of dollars, but the vehicle is still registered to the seller. It’s not unheard of for a seller to then cancel the registration and receive an ad hoc refund of remaining months, also worth hundreds of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlternatively, the driver of the vehicle could well be the criminal we suspect that they are.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, although I jokingly named the project plate-snitch when I set it up on my computer, I’m now faced with the conundrum of whether to report what I saw.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUltimately, the driver was detected using a prototype of a police-only device. But driving on a 2016 registration (canceled, not expired) is a very deliberate move. Hmm.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBack to the Results\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf the many reactions to my article, a significant amount were quite literal and dubious. Since I said I replicated the software, they asserted that I must have a support center, warranties, and training manuals. One even attempted to replicate my results and hit the inevitable roadblocks of image quality and source material.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause of this, some implied that I cherry-picked my source images. To that I can only say, “Well, duh.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I built my initial proof of concept (again, focusing on validating an idea, not replicating BlueNet), I used a small sample set of less than ten images. Since camera setup is one of, if not the most, important factors in ALPR, I selected them for ideal characteristics that enhance recognition.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, it is very simple to take a fragile proof of concept and break it. The true innovation and challenge comes from taking a proof of concept, and making it work. Throughout my professional career, many senior developers have told me that things can’t be done or at least can’t be done in a timely manner. Sometimes they were right. Often, they were just risk averse.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Nothing is impossible until it is proven to be.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany people bastardize this quote, and you may have seen or heard one of it’s incarnations before. To me, it neatly summarizes a healthy development mindset, in which spiking and validating ideas is almost mandatory to understanding them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptimal ALPR Camera Setups\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis project is so exciting and different for me because it has a clear success metric — whether the software recognizes the plate. This can only happen with a combination of hardware, software, and networking solutions. After posting my original article, people who sell ALPR cameras quickly offered advice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptical Zoom\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe most obvious solution in hindsight is the use of an optical zoom. Though I explore other important factors below, none lead to such a sheer increase in recognition as this. In general, professional ALPR solutions are offset at an angle, trained on where the license plate will be, and zoomed into the area to maximize clarity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis means the more zoom, more pixels to play with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the cameras I had at my disposal were of a fixed lens. They included:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Contour HD action camera. These came out in 2009, and I use mine to record my cycling commute and to replay each week’s near death experience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe featured test run was recorded on my phone. My only method of replicating an optical zoom was using an app to record at 3K instead of 1080p, and then digitally zooming and cropping. Again, more pixels to play with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAngle \u0026 Positioning\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe viewing angle of 30° is often referenced as the standard for ideal plate recognition. This is incredibly important when you learn that BlueNet uses an array of cameras. It also makes sense when you consider what a front facing camera would generally see — not very much.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat a front facing ALPR camera sees — not much.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf I had to guess I’d say a mostly forward-facing array would be the ideal setup. It would consist of a single camera pointed dead center as above, two off-center at 30° each side, and a single rear-facing camera. The value in having most of the cameras pointed forward would come from the increased reaction time if the vehicle is traveling in the opposite direction. This would allow a quicker scan, process, and U-turn than if the rear facing cameras picked up a suspect vehicle already ten meters past the police vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA four camera array would need to be angled similar to this. Icons from Freepik.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Gymbal\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen compositing the video, I thought about stabilizing the footage. Instead I opted to show the bumpy ride for what it was. What you saw was me holding my phone near the windscreen while my wife drove. Check out that rigorous scientific method.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAny production-ready version of a vehicle-mounted ALPR needs some form of stabilisation. Not a hand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrame Rate\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBoth the attempt to replicate my project and my recordings since then explored the same misconception that ALPR sampling frame rate may be linked to success. In my experience, this did nothing but waste cycles. Instead, what is incredibly important is the shutter speed creating clean, crisp footage that feeds well into the algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I was also testing fairly low-speed footage. At most, two vehicles passing each other in a 60km/h zone created a 120km/h differential. BlueNet, on the other hand, can work up to an alleged 200km/h.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a way of solving this, a colleague suggested object detection and out-of-band processing. Identify a vehicle and draw a bounding box. Wait for it to come into the ideal recognition angle and zoom. Then shoot a burst of photos for asynchronous processing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI looked into using OpenCV (node-opencv) for object recognition, but I found something simpler like face detection, taking anywhere from 600–800ms. Not only less than ideal for my use, but pretty poor in general.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHype-train TensorFlow comes to the rescue. Able to run on-device, there are examples of projects identifying multiple vehicles per frame at an astounding 27.7fps. This version could even expose speed estimations. Legally worthless, but perhaps useful in every day policing (no fps benchmark in readme).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo better explain how high-performance vehicle recognition could couple with slower ALPR techniques, I created another video in After Effects. I imagine that the two working hand-in-hand would look something like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIdea: how vehicle object detection could remove ALPR frame limits by processing asynchronously.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrame Rate vs Shutter Speed\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA different manifestation of frame rate is largely influenced upon shutter speed, and more specifically, the rolling shutter issues that plague early or low end digital movie recorders. The following is a snapshot from some Contour HD footage. You can see at only 60km/h the rolling shutter issue makes the footage more or less unusable from an ALPR point of view.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdjusting frame rate on both the Contour HD and my iPhone did not result in noticeably less distortion. In theory, a higher shutter speed should produce clearer and crisper images. They’d become increasingly important if you were to chase the 200km/h BlueNet benchmark. Less blur and less rolling shutter distortion would ideally lead to a better read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOpen ALPR Version\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the more interesting discoveries was that the node-openalpr version I was using is both out-of-date and not nearly as powerful as their proprietary solution. While an open source requirement was certainly a factor, it was amazing how accurately the cloud version could successfully read frames that I couldn’t even identify a plate on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eALPR Country Training Data\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also found that the main node-openalpr package defaults to US country processing with no way of overriding it. You have to pull down someone else’s fork which allows you to then provide an extra country parameter.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSlimline Australian plates need their own separate country detection to regular Australian plates?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut this doesn’t always help. Using the default US algorithm I was able to produce the most results. Specifying the Australian data set actually halved the number of successful plate reads, and it only managed to find one or two that the US algorithm couldn’t. Providing the separate “Australian Wide Plate” set again halved the count and introduced a single extra plate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is clearly a lot to be desired when it comes to Australian-based data sets for ALPR, and I think that the sheer number of plate styles available in Victoria is a contributing factor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGood luck with that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlanar Warps\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOpen ALPR comes with one particular tool to reduce the impact of distortion from both the camera angle and rolling shutter issues. Planar warp refers to a method in which coordinates are passed to the library to skew, translate, and rotate an image until it closely resembles a straight-on plate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn my limited testing experience, I wasn’t able to find a planar warp that worked at all speeds. When you consider rolling shutter, it makes sense that the distortion grows relative to vehicle speed. I would imagine feeding accelerometer or GPS speed data as a coefficient might work. Or, you know, get a camera that isn’t completely rubbish.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat others are doing in the industry\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNumerous readers reached out after the last post to share their own experiences and ideas. Perhaps one of the more interesting solutions shared with me was by Auror in New Zealand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey employ fixed ALPR cameras in petrol stations to report on people stealing petrol. This in itself is not particularly new and revolutionary. But when coupled with their network, they can automatically raise an alert when known offenders have returned, or are targeting petrol stations in the area.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndependent developers in Israel, South Africa, and Argentina have shown interest in building their own hacked-together versions of BlueNet. Some will probably fare better than others, as places like Israel use a seven digit license plates with no alphabet characters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKey Takeaways\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is simply too much that I’ve learned in the last few weeks of dabbling to fit into one post. While there have been plenty of detractors, I really do appreciate the support and knowledge that has been sent my way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of challenges you will face in trying to build your own ALPR solution, but thankfully a lot of them are solved problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo put things in perspective, I’m a designer and front end developer. I’ve spent about ten hours now on footage and code, another eight on video production, and at least another ten on write-ups alone. I’ve achieved what I have by standing on the shoulders of giants. I’m installing libraries built by intelligent people and have leveraged advice from people who sell these cameras for a living.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe $86 million question still remains — if you can build a half-arsed solution that does an okay job by standing on the shoulders of giants, how much more money should you pour in to do a really really good job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy solution is not even in the same solar system as the 99.999% accurate scanner that some internet commenters seem to expect. But then again, BlueNet only has to meet a 95% accuracy target.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo if $1 million gets you to 80% accuracy, and maybe $10 million gets you to 90% accuracy — when do you stop spending? Furthermore, considering that the technology has proven commercial applications here in Oceania, how much more taxpayer money should be poured into a proprietary, close-sourced solution when local startups could benefit? Australia is supposed to be an “innovation nation” after all.\u003c/p\u003e",

At least that’s how it feels doesn’t it? No time to learn all the things you think you need to learn to stay ahead of the curve. No time to go back and refactor that ugly piece of code. It works (sort of) and there’s a deadline approaching. No time to write unit tests for everything. No time to write documentation or comments for the next guy who gets stuck maintaining what you wrote. No time to think. No time to breathe. No time!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell… if you take the time to read this article, I promise you’ll find yourself with more time for what’s important.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI used to think that the only way to be a great developer was to work myself sick. My health, friendships, and family all suffered because of it. Understanding the following 5 truths about time management for a developer is what saved me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. You don’t need to learn every new thing in order to stay relevant.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is no question that a good developer should always be learning, but where you focus your learning can make a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to stay on top of your game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“The old thing is dead. Long live the NEW, about-to-be-old thing!”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, don’t get suckered in by headlines on dev blogs that announce a new standard every 37 seconds. Most new technologies, frameworks, and features will never get any real traction and you’ll never need to know them. Those that do emerge will take a lot longer to gain adoption than the blogosphere — and the vendors who hock these new technologies — would have you believe. Companies are invested in their tech stack and, other than a handful of tiny tech startups, they can’t just turn on a dime. So, relax, your career is safe.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFocus your learning on three areas, in the following order of priority:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFundamentals — It’s a lot easier to pick up new skills when you have a real command of the underlying fundamentals. For example, if you understand JavaScript deeply, you can master any new JavaScript framework in record speed. If you understand Object Oriented Programming deeply, you can master new object oriented languages quickly, too. Deeply learning the fundamentals will 10x your learning efficiency. Always focus on improving fundamentals above all else.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe latest version/feature of the stack(s) you use the most — There’s a stack of technologies that you probably use every day. These are the tools that will put food on the table for you and your family. When new versions of these tools are released, it’s worth investing the time to learn about them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn-demand tech that is backed by market leaders — if a big, well established company like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft puts out something new and it starts getting some buzz, it’s worth looking into. There were a hundred and one JavaScript frameworks all vying for attention and then Angular and React showed up and wiped them off the map. I’m not saying there won’t be disruptors that come from nowhere and become the next big thing but, more often than not, no-name tech is just noise.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearning time should be a part of your schedule. Set aside a specific amount of time for learning every day. It doesn’t need to be a lot of time, even 25 minutes of reading and experimentation every day adds up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Writing good code takes less time than writing bad code, BUT it doesn’t feel that way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou probably feel like the time you spend on a new feature ends when you run the code and it appears to work. But that’s just the beginning of your time investment. Time spent on a feature includes time spent debugging that feature later and also time spent refactoring and working other code around any poor design decisions you made when implementing that feature. When you start to understand your time investment this way, it becomes obvious that, in the long run, fewer errors and better design are a worthwhile investment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are two things you can do that will reduce errors in your code and lead to better design.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse test-driven development. Write the test first, then write the code that satisfies the test. This not only leads to less buggy code but also to better design, because when you have to structure code in a testable way, you end up making smaller, simpler functions that have fewer dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse an iterative design approach. Don’t spend time trying to make code perfect before you’ve spent time trying to make the code work. You’ll never, ever get it right completely in your head. You have to get those fingers banging on a keyboard and produce code that runs and does what’s expected. The problem is that developers tend to make one of two common mistakes; either they spend too much time thinking and not enough time actually doing, or they don’t spend enough time improving their first solution. Follow the mantra first stated by Kent Beck: “make it work, make it right, make it fast” — and in that order.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Working 24/7 does NOT make you a hero. Managing expectations does.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is the one that nearly killed me. I used to agree and commit to any crazy timeline my boss or client could come up with. I was afraid of saying “no.” I was afraid of letting anyone down. I would do whatever it took to deliver. I have literally slept under my desk, and pulled multiple caffeine-fueled 40+ hour marathon coding sessions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt first I was a shining star. I would get a big pat on the back and I felt like a hero. But I set an expectation that was impossible to live up to. Working like that is unsustainable. Eventually, I started to burn out, get sick, and miss deadlines. I started getting a reputation as unreliable and inconsistent. It was bad news.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I eventually came to understand, and what you should commit to learning too, is that the real heroes are the ones who are consistently reliable. They say what they’ll do and do what they say. The only way to be that kind of hero is to manage expectations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou need to take control of the timelines so that you are always and without fail delivering high quality work exactly on time. This is incredibly difficult at first. It means having to say “no” and having to push back.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, your boss or client won’t be thrilled by your resistance, but once you demonstrate that you are trustworthy and reliable, everything will start to change.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver time, other developers will be late, deliver sloppy work, or burn out and become unreliable. Then you will become the real hero of your team. In fact, learning this made me one of the most in demand consultants in my market. I’ve built a stellar reputation for quality and timeliness, because I vigorously manage expectations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Not all time spent “improving” code has the same ROI.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpending time is an investment. Like all investments, it’s reasonable to expect a return on investment (ROI). You should be getting back at least as much — and hopefully more — value than you put in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe talked about “make it work, make it right, make it fast.” It’s a good mantra but there is a trap: “right” does not mean perfect, and “fast” does not mean absolutely as fast as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Right” means that the code works consistently and is easy to refactor. “Fast” means that the speed of execution does not have a negative impact on the overall user experience. The most important thing is that your application feels fast to the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, don’t waste time trying to shave time off a function that is barely used, or trying to save another few milliseconds on something that already runs faster than a human can blink (~300ms). And don’t waste time trying to refactor working, well-structured code because you just learned some new technique or approach that you’ve convinced yourself you suddenly have to go back and apply to everything you’ve ever done.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Scheduled down time makes you more productive.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis was a very hard one for me to learn and accept. How can you possibly be more productive when you’re not spending all your time producing? Well, it’s true.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to Allison Gabriel, an assistant professor of management at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies job demands and employee motivation, “There is a lot of research that says we have a limited pool of cognitive resources. When you are constantly draining your resources, you are not being as productive as you can be. If you get depleted, we see performance decline. You’re able to persist less and have trouble solving tasks”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlways working sets off strain reactions, such as stress, fatigue, and negative mood. These drain your focus and your physical and emotional resources.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe brain’s ability to self-regulate — to stay disciplined — wanes with each exercise of self-control during the day. It’s a loss of resources that must be replenished. Otherwise it becomes harder to stay on-task, be attentive and solve problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour mind and body need down time, and they’re going to get it whether you like it or not. So, schedule that down time. Actually plan and put on your calendar real scheduled breaks. This will allow you to take down time without feeling guilty about it. It will make work-time easier to endure because you’ll know that you have a scheduled break right around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMore help and resources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you even more, I’ve put together a list of free and useful resources (videos, tutorials and websites) that can help you better understand and implement the insights I’ve just shared with you.

In this podcast, he details the steps he took to land interviews at Google, Twitter, and other prestigious companies that led to his dream job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten by Austin Belcak: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/janephilipps\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/abelcak\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead by Abbey Rennemeyer: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2F8uE2H\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2F8uE2H\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eShortly after college, I began chasing something many people want but few ever get: a job they love.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI left school with a biology degree and a job in the medical field. It took me about two weeks to realize I absolutely hated it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was working 6 days a week, waking up at 3:30am in order to be at the hospital by 5:30. Making next to nothing, I quickly racked up $10,000 in credit card debt. I knew I deserved more, but I had no idea how to get it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw people in my graduating class living in New York or San Francisco, making six figure salaries and going on exotic trips. I often wondered what they had figured out that I hadn’t. What was their secret?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI dedicated the next 12 months of my life to finding the answer. In this article I’m going to share everything I learned along the way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, I’ll walk you through the exact process you can use to get a job interview at your dream company even if you don’t know a single person there — you won’t even need to apply online.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, I’ll teach you how to ace the interview process, get the offer, and land a salary you deserve.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI personally used these exact strategies to get interviews and offers at companies like Google, Uber and Twitter. They are also the same tactics that my students have used to land interviews and offers at Google, Microsoft, Slack, Deloitte, PWC, American Express, ESPN and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReferrals Are The Most Effective Way To Get Hired\u003cbr /\u003e A recent LinkedIn survey on talent trends showed that 1 in 3 people were actively looking for new work. As of January 2017, the population of employed people in the United States was 123 million. This means that, at any given time, 41 million people are looking for work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn average, an open role at a well known company gets ~250 resumes. 75% of these resumes came from some sort of online portal (like the company’s online application, or a career aggregator site like Indeed.com).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce submitted, these applications are screened by Applicant Tracking software that scans them for keywords. At the end of the process, ~5 resumes make it into the hands of a recruiter. That’s 2% at best.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdditionally, The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that 80% of jobs aren’t advertised online.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat means that 75% of people applying for jobs are all competing for 20% of the opportunities!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOops.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to getting hired, referrals are the most effective way to secure an interview and land the offer. Here are some stats from a recent Jobvite survey:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e40% of hires come from referrals, the next largest channel is via career sites at 21% (almost half as many)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReferrals get hired in an average of 3 weeks while other applicants take up to 7 weeks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReferrals get paid more on average than cold applicants\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e40% of hires come from referrals (courtesy of Jobvite.com)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, over 50% of six figure jobs are filled via referral.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMoral of the story? If we want to get hired at our dream job, we need to find another way to get a referral from an insider.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe problem is, many of us don’t happen to have friends or family working at places like Google.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePart 1: How To Get A Job Interview When You Don’t Know A Single Person At The Company\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKnow Your Role (And Find It)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first step is having a solid idea of the specific role you are looking for, down to the company and title if possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, you need to make sure that role is available. For today, let’s assume that you want to be an Account Manager in the Technology B2B vertical at Google. Looks like a spot is open in New York:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLocate Potential Influencers\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, you are going to find someone who not only knows about the role, but could potentially have an impact on hiring for it. Time to fire up LinkedIn.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the search bar, plug in the company name + all of the information I highlighted above (title, vertical/industry, preferred city). However, before you hit “Search,” we need to remember that you are looking for someone who can influence the hiring process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, I usually use a title that is one level up from the position that I’m looking for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re not familiar with title hierarchy structures in the corporate world, here is a quick guide (if you are already familiar with how titles are structured, feel free to skip this section):\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSide Note: A Brief Guide To Company Organizational Structures By Title\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery company has a hierarchy starting at the top with the CEO/Founder all the way down to the entry level employees. When researching companies, especially people to speak to within those companies, it helps to know where certain titles fit in the food chain. That way you can ensure you are talking to the right person.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is a general list of titles that fits almost any company, starting at the top:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eC-­Level (CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, etc.)\u003cbr /\u003e Vice President (VP)\u003cbr /\u003e Director\u003cbr /\u003e Senior Manager\u003cbr /\u003e Manager\u003cbr /\u003e Coordinator (Entry Level)\u003cbr /\u003e Associates, Executives, and Seniors\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn many companies, the above titles have some sort of variation that allows for greater segmentation within that level. The most common forms of this are Associate, Executive, and Senior. Here is what those mean:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAssociate: this title is usually given to someone who is halfway between positions for some reason (maybe there is typically a 4 year gap between levels and they are 2 years in). A person with Associate in their title is usually one notch below a person with the original title.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, an Associate Account Manager would most likely be one level below an Account Manager.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSenior: ­this title is the more experienced version of an Associate. People with Senior in their title are usually one notch above the original title. For example, a Senior Account Manager would be one notch above an Account Manager.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eExecutive: ­this title is usually given to people who are very senior, or around the level of Vice President. The two most common cases are\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSales Executive/Account Executive (synonymous terms for a senior salesperson) or Executive Vice President who is two notches above a Vice\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePresident and one notch above a Senior Vice President. That should be all the info you need to make an educated decision around where people stand within the company you are researching.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you’re familiar with the company structure, let’s get back to finding that influencer who can help you land this job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince we are looking for an Account Manager role, the next step up would be Senior Account Manager so your LinkedIn search would look like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur first result? A Senior Account Manager who works in B2B at Google:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eObtaining Contact Info\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow we’re going to reach out and set up a meeting. It’s best to do these in person but over the phone can work well if you’re dream job is in another state or country.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to get in touch with our influencer, we’re going to need their contact info. Here are 3 strategies you can use to find almost anyone’s corporate email address:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLinkedIn\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis one is obvious but it’s a big time saver and definitely worth the 10 seconds it takes to check.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the person’s profile, right under their picture, there can be a button labeled “Contact Info” (I say “can be” because people have the option to remove it). Occasionally, people will have their email address listed right there — voila!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf not, let’s move right along…\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReverse Lookup\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHead over to Voila Norbert and enter the first and last name of the person you are searching for, as well as their company’s website. For example, if we were trying to find Larry Page’s email, our form would look like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce it spits out their email you can confirm it using MailTester.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMatching Formats\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf that doesn’t work, you can try finding someone else’s email at the company and use that format reverse engineering your target email address.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, using Larry Page again, if I know that my buddy John Smith’s email is john at google.com then I can assume that Larry’s email is larry at google.com.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe easiest way to get a hold of a company email address is to reach out to someone in sales or media because both of these departments usually have inbound lead forms and people on the other end ready to pounce on those leads.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe can also use our LinkedIn method here and target salespeople.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSalespeople almost always have their corporate email listed on their LinkedIn because it’s a free win for them. If someone is looking for their product and then finds them on LinkedIn, boom — they just got an effortless inbound lead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have the format, you can use MailTester to confirm your target email address.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eResearch, Research, Research\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you have your potential influencer, it’s time to do some research so you can effectively reach out and build that relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStart with the usual suspects — LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and look for common points of interest. To be honest, most people are better at this online research thing than I am, so I’ll get back to the meat here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne thing I will say is, don’t skimp. The more you get to know this person beforehand, the better your chances of landing a referral from them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome people have said to me, “Austin, isn’t this a little weird? I feel like I’m kind of stalking this person.” I totally get it. However, this information is critical for quickly building a strong relationship and getting that referral.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlso, in my experience, people tend to expect that you’ve done some research on them. The key is to understand what is kosher to bring up out of the blue and what isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePeople are OK with you checking out their LinkedIn, but they may be a little weirded out if you mention that picture from Saturday’s Bar Crawl you saw on Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy general rule of thumb is this: if it exists on LinkedIn, it’s fair game to bring up. If you found it somewhere else (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) use a different method. For example, if I see that my influencer is a skiing fanatic, I may bring up that I went on a ski trip a few weeks beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSending The Email\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you have your potential influencer and their contact info, it’s time to reach out. Not only is this one of the scarier parts of this process, it is also the most pivotal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you get past that hump, I’ve included the exact email script that I used to reach out to people. In this case, I’m reaching out to\u003cbr /\u003e Tim who works at Google:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSubject: Quick Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi Tim,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy name is Austin and I currently work at Cultivated Culture. I was browsing through LinkedIn and came across your information — I hope you don’t mind me reaching out of the blue here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw that you have extensive experience in Google’s Technology B2B vertical and I’m very interested in learning more about that space. I would love to have the opportunity to run some questions by you, as well as tap into any advice you may have given your knowledge of the industry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI know that your time is extremely valuable so please don’t feel to need to respond in depth. If you do have 5 minutes to chat, I would really appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a few key points to the email above:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAddress the person you are emailing by name\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eState who you are and make it personable\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInclude some flattery that positions the person as an “expert”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs for the subject, Fast Company did a study where they emailed 1,000 C-level executives from Fortune \u0026 Inc 500 companies. They found that the subject line “Quick Question” made up 66.7% of total replies. I saw similar results.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll of that said, this script is just a framework. You will most likely need to tweak your emails to fit the situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen that time comes, I recommend checking out Sam Parr’s incredible guide on how to cold email like a boss (Sam has started conversations with Jeff Bezos and Brian Lee (aka Jessica Alba’s Honest co-founder) via cold email). It’s the same guide I used to help craft my email templates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow hit Send!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePrepare For Your Meeting\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to prepare, we have to know what we’re preparing for. The goal of your meeting is to position your influencer as an expert, make them feel special, and build a relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou should not and will not mention anything about the opening at their company. People innately enjoy helping others and if you follow the steps above, they will bring this up naturally.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou will want to prepare a list of questions that gets them to open up about themselves and the company. I like to ask them several softballs to get things warmed up and then hit them with a few questions they are guaranteed to remember.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is a quick set that I’ve had success with in the past (I’ve found the last one really seems to stick):\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw you worked at [Previous Companies]. How did you end up going from [First Industry] to becoming interested in [Current Company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou hear a lot about [Current Company] in the news, but I’d love to hear more about why you love working there. What’s your favorite part?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is one totally unexpected lesson you’ve learned from working at [Current Company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe “Million Dollar” Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRegardless of the questions you choose, there is one that you must always be sure to ask:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“What is the biggest challenge your team is facing right now?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReally dig in here, get them to be specific. This information is going to be critical in helping you land a referral from this person, as well as getting the offer farther down the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour Homework: Adding Value (In A Big Way)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOkay, so you met with your influencer, things went great, and you identified a major pain point that the team is having. Now we’re going to focus on that last piece.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver the next week you are going to research the crap out of your influencer’s problem. Then you are going to come up with a solution and draft up a proposal for how you would solve it. Your proposal should include:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA summary of the problem (to illustrate that you understand their pain)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA step-by-step framework of how you would solve this problem\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA brief outline of how your skill set positions you as an asset to implement that solution\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTruthfully, this process deserves a post of its own but this should give you a good idea of what you need to do. If you’re the type of person that likes concrete examples, check out this guerrilla usability test that Raghav Haran ran for Airbnb.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have all of this information, consolidate it into a Word document, head over to Upwork, and hire a graphic designer to make your proposal look amazing. If you’ve never hired on Upwork before, here is an amazing guide by Dave Nevogt on how to do it right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFollowing Up With Your Proposal\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow we’re going to reach back out to our influencer with the proposal. Here’s the template I used:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Influencer],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThanks again for taking the time out to chat last week.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent a lot of time thinking about what you said regarding [team’s biggest challenge]. In fact, I created a short framework that should help you solve it. Please find that attached.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you have some time, I would love to chat about it in more detail.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlease let me know if you have any questions, I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s very important that you do not mention the open position in any of your emails or the proposal. Be patient and wait for their response. When they do get back to you, they will not only bring up the opening but they will ask you if you’re interested.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKindly accept and play it cool. You’re in!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePart 2: How To Breeze Through The Interview Process\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFast forward — our influencer passed along our resume to HR and they have reached out to set up a phone screen. Once we get past that, we’ll be on to interviewing with the team, and then getting the job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA note to developers: The advice below does not cover technical interviews, which are typically required for developer/software roles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, the advice below will help create more time to prepare for technical interviews by minimizing the amount of preparation needed for other parts of the interview process. If you are applying for a development role, I suggest you read Cracking The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInterviews can be daunting, especially at companies like Google, Amazon, or Uber. I’m sure you’ve read the horror stories about crazy questions they ask people like “Quick — How many golf balls can fit inside a school bus,” or, “how many gas stations are there in Manhattan?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe truth is, most of these companies have done away with those questions. They crunched the numbers and found that the answers didn’t correlate with high employee performance (shocker, I know). In fact, Google’s own Senior Vice President of People Operations called them a “complete waste of time.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese companies have since reverted back to the standard style of interviews, which is great for us because it makes it much easier to identify patterns. We can essentially “guess” what questions will be on the test and prepare answers that will blow our interviewers away (it works way better than it did in college, I swear).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is the process I used to prepare for each one.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNailing The Basics: Questions You’ll Get In Every Interview\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to renowned career guru Penelope Trunk, one of the easiest ways to be a better interviewer is to prepare for the most obvious questions. You may be saying “well duh,” but you’d be surprised by how many people spread themselves too thin by trying to prepare answers to every possible question.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e99% of the interviews you go on will follow the exact same template. If you can master the format, your confidence will skyrocket and you’ll be prepared for almost any situation you get thrown into.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Universal Job Interview Format:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about yourself (your experience, why you are interested in this role, etc.)\u003cbr /\u003e A mix of behavioral questions, which we’ll dive into shortly\u003cbr /\u003e What questions do you have for me (the interviewer)?\u003cbr /\u003e Let’s tackle each individually.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell Me About Yourself\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is your first impression. More importantly, it’s the only part of the interview that you totally control. Do NOT rattle off your resume like a grocery list.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn order to nail this part you need to craft an interesting story — your story. You want it to be concise (around 2–3 minutes) and you need to think about what you want to convey. I recommend:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eChoosing 2–3 themes to build your story around (for me, those themes were Persistence, Agility, and Success)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIncluding quantitative metrics whenever possible\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAddressing the question of why you want to leave your current position (they are going to ask you this anyways, addressing it early shows that you’re aware it’s a concern of theirs and helps put them at ease)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help get you started, here is what my story looked like. To give you some context, I was a biology major who was interested in landing a job in digital marketing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGrowing up, like most people, I wanted to be a doctor. I went to [college] where I majored in biology and planned my course to medical school. Not long after, I decided that pre-med wasn’t for me. I wanted to get into digital marketing, and I wanted to be in New York. I set my sights on this goal and created a plan that would get me there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 2013, I graduated with my biology degree and took a job in medical device sales where I worked from 5:30am — 12:30pm covering surgical cases in the operating room. Then, every day, I would come home and study digital marketing until 8:00pm. In order to gain relevant experience, I got certified in Google Analytics \u0026 AdWords and created my own consulting firm that focused on using search engine marketing to generate leads for private golf communities. We were able to increase home sales by an average of 20% while reducing the cost per lead by around 10%. Armed with my new credentials, I began to look for positions in New York.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEventually, I was offered a position at my current company (a promotional analytics company in New York). During my tenure there I have grown my book of business by 467%, spearheaded the creation of an internal group dedicated to marketing the company on the internet, and helped close the second largest deal in company history.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHowever, the company has restructured several times since I was brought on. I’ve had 3 different managers over the past year, as well as 3 titles with different sets of responsibilities. I’m looking for something a bit more stable and [company I am interviewing at] has been somewhere that I have wanted to work since I got into this industry. I’m really excited to have this opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePro Tip: You are telling a story. Don’t be afraid to embellish a bit. I’m not saying you should lie or make up stories, but you want to sell yourself and you can bet your butt that your competition isn’t afraid to inflate their credentials.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBehavioral Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext up is the dreaded set of behavioral questions. The ones meant to tease out your thought process and your ability to be a “team player.” This is the part where our educated “guesses” are going to come in handy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe behavioral section is broken down into two parts that I call Standard Questions and Company Specific Questions. Let’s start with the former.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStandard Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou are going to be asked a variation of one, if not all, of these questions in every single interview you go to:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy do you want to work for us?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you exhibited leadership\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time where you had to work as a team\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you’ve had to work with a difficult person, or difficult people\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you failed\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time you overcame an obstacle\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me about a time when you had success\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you can answer these 6 questions, you can handle 9 out of 10 interviews with no other preparation and be totally fine. Just follow the same set of rules I mentioned above in the Tell Me About Yourself section:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCraft a concise story\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake sure to include quantitative metrics that illustrate your success\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnticipate and address objections\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCompany Specific Questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are questions that fall in the middle of the 7 listed above and “why are man hole covers round?” Never fear though, we can anticipate these too.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHead over to GlassDoor. If you’ve never heard of GlassDoor, it’s a great resource for any job seeker that includes salaries, reviews, and interview information for almost any company in the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, you are going to search for the position you’re applying for. In keeping with our theme, we’ll search for “Google” under Companies \u0026 Reviews:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNext, we’re going to click on the “Interviews” Tab:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen scroll down and click on “Filter Interviews” which will bring up some advanced settings. Here we’ll type in the title of the job we want (Account Manager, in this case) and the location (New York, NY). We’ll also select “Received Offer” because the people who didn’t receive offers tend to be slightly, ahem, biased:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis will pull up a list of reviews from everyone who interviewed and received an offer for that position. The general comments are really helpful, but we want to focus on a section called Interview Questions towards the bottom. I usually comb through 10–15 of these and add all of the interview questions into a Word doc so I can answer them later:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow you have your second set of questions to prepare for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat Questions Do You Have For Me?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, once they are done peppering you with questions, your interviewer will ask if you have any questions for them. This is the most crucial part of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy? Because so many people neglect it. If you can ask some questions that are even slightly outside of the box, I’ve found that really sticks with the interviewer more than any other part of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter every interview I’ve been on, I asked for feedback. Without fail, the interviewer made a positive comment about the questions I asked. The good news for you is that I asked the same exact questions in every single one. Here they are:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is your favorite part about working here?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say that, in one year, you are looking back on this hire. What has that person done to exceed expectations on every level?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAsk about a current event (for example — I saw that [Competitor X] came out with this product. How do you see that affecting your business?)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is the most unexpected lesson you’ve learned while working at [company]?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTell me a little bit more about you, what do you like to do outside of work?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese questions work because they are based on specific principles of behavioral psychology. They break down barriers and help build a positive association in your interviewer’s mind. If you’re interested in the details, you can read more about it here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSay Thank You\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile we’re on the subject, be absolutely sure to send a thank you note to everyone you interviewed with. Also include a personal touch to each one (something that you gained from that last question).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany people I talk to say “but I don’t have their email.” Ask for it! At the end of every interview always, always ask for a business card or write down the person’s email in your notebook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you forget, try using the techniques I outlined above for finding people’s emails and you should be fine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePart 3 — Following Up \u0026 What To Do If They Say No\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is one of the most common mistakes I see from job applicants. I understand how nerve wracking it is to sit there and wait while everything is completely out of your hands.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the toughest things I had to learn throughout my interview process was that, while this is a HUGE deal to you, it’s really just another agenda item on the hiring manager’s schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey will get back to you, and if they don’t? You don’t want to work for someone who doesn’t have the courtesy of replying to the people they do business with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen Can I Send Them A Reminder?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe rule of thumb is one business week. If you interviewed on a Tuesday, wait until the next Tuesday to email them (as J.T. O'Donnell says, never send a nudge on a Monday). When you do, don’t push or be blunt. Keep it short and sweet:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Interviewer],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope you had a great week!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wanted to quickly follow up and see if there was anything else I could help with regarding the application process. If so, please let me know.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s it. If they don’t respond to that after another 3–4 days, you have your answer and it’s time to move on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat Happens If They Say No?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUgh. The worst case scenario. Don’t get down just yet though, we’re not done here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have this quality where I have trouble taking “no” as an answer. When I was interviewing with Google, the initial screener told me that she wasn’t going to put me through because she “didn’t think I was qualified, and didn’t want to waste the team’s time.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was not happy. So I sent her this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi [Recruiter],\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThank you again for carving out the time to speak this afternoon. I really appreciate your feedback, and I wanted to add one final note:\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I completely understand your concerns regarding my experience with [skill]. You are correct that I didn’t have much experience with that at [previous company]. That said, this doesn’t stem from an inability to produce results, but rather a lack of opportunity to do so.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile my experience on paper may not match up to the initial expectations of the position’s description, I have do have two qualities that work in my favor: I am an extremely efficient learner, and am also very effective at translating those learnings into practice. Second, I’m much more tenacious than your average individual. My career has hinged on these two qualities.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I left college with no digital experience and a biology degree — all of my digital knowledge was obtained through self study. I spent 8 months selling myself without the on-paper experience to back it up. When I was finally given the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a business setting, I playing a critical role in landing the company’s 2nd largest deal in history. I am confident that I can have the same success in this role. I have the resources necessary to learn what I need in order to be successful at [company], and am prepared to do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I understand that [company’s] interview process is extremely challenging, and that only the top talent ends up with an offer letter at the end. I also believe that I am worthy of a shot at that letter. [Company] is known for hiring people who excel at the intangibles, as well the ability to learn new things and apply them to existing knowledge. That is my forte.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e I am not asking for an offer. I am simply asking for the opportunity to speak with the hiring manager to make my case for the position. I’m sure you will find the best person for the position, I would just like to have a legitimate shot at being that person. If you give me that chance, my next set of answers will not disappoint.\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cbr /\u003e Thank you again for your continued consideration.\u003cbr /\u003e Best,\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAustin\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that may be a little aggressive…\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOk, it was pretty aggressive. But she wrote me back an hour later and pushed me through to the next round! Mission accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe moral of the story here is, don’t give up if you get a “No.” Try to identify why you were turned down and then send a note to hiring manager addressing those items (feel free to copy mine).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTaking Action\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere you have it. The exhaustive, step-by-step guide to landing an interview and then getting an offer from the company of your dreams. What are you waiting for? Get out there and start researching!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eFor several days not that long ago, Jordan Reid's site, ramshackleglam.com, did not belong to her. She got it back, but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies, middle-of-the-night conferences with lawyers, FBI intervention, and what amounted to a massive sting operation. Here's her story. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten by Jordan Reid: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/vmvaughn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ramshackleglam\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead by Abbey Rennemeyer: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/abbeyrenn\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2EA3OjL\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2EA3OjL\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript: \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor several days not so long ago, RamshackleGlam.com — the domain name that I have owned and operated since March of 2010 — did not belong to me, but rather to a man who goes by the name “bahbouh” on an auction website called Flippa, and who was attempting to sell off the site to the highest bidder (with a “Buy It Now” price of $30,000.00). He promised the winner my traffic, my files, and my data, and suggested that I was available “for hire” to continue writing posts (alternatively, he was willing to provide the winner with “high-quality articles” and “SEO advice” to maintain the site’s traffic post-sale).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI learned that my site was stolen on a Saturday. Three days later I had it back, but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies, middle-of-the-night conferences with lawyers, FBI intervention, and what amounted to a sting operation that probably should have starred Sandra Bullock instead of…well…me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf course I’ve heard of identity theft, and of cyber hacking, but honestly, my attitude towards these things was very much “it could never happen to me.” And even if it did…I didn’t exactly understand why it was such a huge deal. Couldn’t you just explain to people what had happened, prove who you were, and sort it all out? We live in such a highly documented world, it seemed completely impossible to me that someone could actually get away with pretending to be someone else with any real consequences beyond a few phone calls and some irritation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s much, much worse — more threatening, more upsetting, and more difficult (if not impossible) to fix — than I’d ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI found out about the hacking from my father. His friend Anthony (who runs a web development and consulting company called ThoughtBox) had been surfing around on Flippa and had — in an impossibly lucky coincidence — noticed that my site was up for auction, with what appeared to be a highly suspicious listing. Suddenly, I remembered the email I had gotten the day before — an email that I had disregarded as spam — from someone “interested in the purchase” of my “weblog.” I remembered the notification from YouTube that someone had accessed my account from a different location — a notification I had ignored, assuming that I had logged in on a mobile device or that my husband had accidentally logged into my account instead of his own.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut even after I saw the listing, I didn’t panic: this seemed like something that could be fixed with a couple of emails. Except the auction site was located in Australia and didn’t appear to have a phone number, and when I sent an email with a scanned ID and proof of ownership what I got back was a form letter. And when I called HostMonster, the site I pay to operate my website, I discovered that I was no longer the owner of my site: someone had used their email confirmation system to authorize the transfer of my domain name into a private account at GoDaddy (another web registrar service of whom I’m also a client).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy is this a big deal?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you have a business that depends on a URL, you understand why this was such upsetting news: With control over my website’s domain name, a hacker would be able to take the site down, or redirect it elsewhere. Further, it was later verified that the hacker had control over all of the site’s content, as well; he could have just rerouted everything I’ve ever written to any location he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRamshackle Glam may be “just” a lifestyle blog about things like parenting and fashion and decor…but it’s also a site that I’ve spent five years of my life building, and the idea of it falling into the hands of someone with malicious intent was heartbreaking. I could switch to a new URL and export a copy of my content (which I do back up), but that would result in the loss of a substantial amount of traffic. The website is my primary source of income, and with a house, two children, a book coming out, and a husband in business school, this was not a joke. The loss of my URL had the potential to be devastating for my business and for my family in a very real way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo what did I do?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe events of the next few days were complicated, so rather than go through them chronologically I’m going to explain how each path I took ended up panning out (I’m going into detail so that I can be as much help as possible to anyone who goes through this themselves).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. I tried to resolve the situation directly with GoDaddy and HostMonster. This did not work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom Sunday through Tuesday, I spent most of the day (and much of the night) on the phone with GoDaddy, HostMonster, or both at the same time, and nearly every person I spoke with gave me the same response: “Sorry, can’t help you.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHostMonster maintained that because they no longer controlled the domain name, there was nothing they could do. GoDaddy maintained that because the account was private and the person had obtained ownership of the domain through a transfer from HostMonster, there was nothing they could do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat finally made a difference: I cited ICANN’s policy on Domain Name Dispute Resolution.* This got my case upgraded, but it did not result in action.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s why: the legal department at HostMonster informed me that in order for them to initiate a transfer dispute that would result in GoDaddy releasing the domain back to me, their “internal investigation” would have to turn up evidence that they had done something wrong in releasing the site. In other words, they would have to admit that they had screwed up…which would in turn open them up to a lawsuit.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, I never heard from the legal department again. Despite the fact that everyone seemed clear on the fact that I owned my website and that it had been transferred without my authorization, nothing was going to be done unless I initiated a time-consuming and costly lawsuit that, in any case, would not result in action quick enough to save my domain name from being sold.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo that avenue came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. I called the FBI. This was a major step in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe morning after I found out about the unauthorized transfer, I also called the FBI. I felt silly and dramatic making the phone call, but the reality is that this is an international cyber crime issue, and that’s FBI territory. And this is my business. It’s how I support my family, and it may be a “small matter” in the grand scheme of things, but it is not a small matter to me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd let me tell you: of all the surprises I’ve had over the past week or so, most surprising of all has been the FBI. They responded immediately, with follow-up phone calls and emails, an in-person interview with two special agents at my own home within 24 hours, and a follow-up visit from two agents yesterday. Beyond that, each and every agent I have interacted with over the past week has been, without fail, compassionate, thoughtful, invested, respectful, and committed to action…in addition to treating me not like a case number, but like a human.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I expected was to leave a message with a general mailbox and at some point receive a form letter; I certainly did not expect to see an active investigation opened immediately. I’m not going to write more about the investigation because it’s still ongoing (although I did ask for and receive permission to write about this), but I think it’s important to say how absolutely blown away I have been by the FBI’s response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. I tried to regain control by dealing directly with the “seller”. This worked, but not without considerable drama.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile all of the above was going on, I was also working to regain control over the site directly from the individual who was trying to sell it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to contact the “seller” directly, because I felt that if he thought the “real” owner of the site was aware of the sale, he would try to extort more money. So I asked Anthony — the person who had found the original listing, and who had an active account with a positive history on Flippa — to DM “bahbouh” to see if he was interested in a “private sale”. After some back-and-forth we reached an agreement, and it was decided that a third-party money-transfer website (Escrow.com) would be used to make the sale: the money would only be released to the seller upon confirmation that the domain name had been transferred.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis appeared to be going smoothly until Tuesday night, when the seller suddenly demanded that the funds be released immediately (prior to receipt of the website). When we pushed back, he announced that he was selling it to someone else: “Sorry, bye.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo here was my thought process: if we did not release the money to the seller, we were guaranteed to not get the website. If we did release the money to him, there was a possibility that he would take the money and run, and also a possibility that he would deliver the site as promised. It wasn’t a gamble I wanted to take…but I didn’t see any option. And so I authorized the wire transfer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent twenty minutes sitting in front of the dummy GoDaddy account I had created to receive the domain name from the seller, waiting to see whether I was out thousands of dollars and a domain name, or just thousands of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd then it came through.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI immediately transferred the domain into a different account and placed it (and all of my other domain names) on what amounted to lockdown. And then I called the wire transfer company and placed a stop on the payment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe end result\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRamshackleGlam.com is back in my possession, thanks to a number of people who dedicated hours (in some cases days) out of their lives to doing whatever they could to help me. My other accounts — bank accounts, et cetera — have been secured. I don’t have my money back yet, but the man who stole my site from me doesn’t have it, either, and won’t be getting it, ever.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd that’s an ending I’m pretty damn thrilled with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo why am I still angry?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf course I’m angry with the person or people who stole the site, but that’s out of my hands. The reason I’m writing this post is to let people know that this really can happen — to anyone — and to offer suggestions for how to minimize the chances that it will happen to you (below), but beyond that, I’m writing this post because this incident made me very, very angry at GoDaddy and HostMonster. And I want you to know why.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNo one at either company questioned my statement (supported by written proof) that the website belonged to me. No one doubted that it had been transferred without my authority. And yet I had to spend days — days during which the hacker could have done virtually anything he wanted — trying to reach one single person who was able to do anything, because the support staff and supervisors I spoke with (who had to have numbered fifty or more) were completely uninformed as to how to handle this situation beyond saying, “Jeez, that sucks. Can’t help you.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd once I reached people who could help me — who could literally make a single phone call or push a single button and return my property to me (or simply freeze it so that it could not be sold or destroyed) — they would not. They hid behind their legal departments and refused to do anything, knowing full well that their inaction would force me to either interact with and pay off a criminal, or lose an essential component of my business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd hackers know that these companies will do this.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey rely on it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a serious problem when a criminal enterprise not only exists “despite” a company’s policies, but actually thrives as a direct result of that company’s prioritization of their own interests over the security of the clients they allegedly “protect”. Do I understand why companies like HostMonster and GoDaddy are focused on protecting themselves against lawsuits? Of course I do. But the fact is that they not only do not “help” their customers, but actively contribute to creating situations that threaten small businesses and the families that they support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd these companies know that when they stonewall clients whose property has obviously been stolen that these clients will have no other recourse than to pay off criminals or watch their businesses — sometimes their very lives — collapse. They know that by standing in the way of immediate action they create the very environment that these criminals depend upon to perpetuate their business model. And they do nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis has to change.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy opinion, for what it’s worth\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSupport personnel at hosting companies should be made intimately familiar with ICANN regulations involving domain disputes, and should be able to initiate a plan of action the first time a client makes them aware of a situation, not after hours and hours of repeated calls.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFurther, the establishment of a TEAC** should result in an immediate freeze on the account in dispute until the situation has been resolved. This should not require an admission of culpability on the part of any parties; simply an acknowledgement that a dispute exists and an awareness that while the dispute exists the domain must be held safe from sale or transfer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat you can do to reduce the chances that this will happen to you:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHave a really, really good password, and change it often. Your password should not contain “real” words (and definitely not more than one real word in immediate proximity, like “whitecat” or “angrybird”), and should contain capital letters, numbers and symbols. The best passwords of all look like total nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf possible, use a separate computer (an old one or a cheap one purchased for this purpose) for things like banking; if your family computer is the same one that you use for bank transactions you risk having your kids click on a bad link that results in a hacking.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTurn off your computer and personal devices when they’re not in use.\u003cbr /\u003e Have antivirus software on your computer (but remember that virus scans only catch 30–40% of viruses, so unfortunately a “clean” check doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re safe).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePurchase CyberRisk Insurance (learn more about it here; it basically protects businesses from cyber attacks and data breaches.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut if it does happen to you, here’s what to do:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBegin taking careful notes (and screenshots) immediately. Don’t delete any emails or other information; it could all be important later on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eImmediately change all of your passwords (including — but not limited to — domain registrar, website hosting, website login information, email, bank accounts, wireless home electronics, and Apple ID) according to the rules stated below. I changed mine every few hours while this situation was still up in the air, and am continuing to change them every few days for the time being.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eContact the registrar(s), citing the ICANN policy below, and see if together you can arrive at a speedy resolution. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself running into dead ends.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake sure to inquire about “filters” and “rules” that may have been placed on your email (basically, any kind of device that the hackers may have placed to forward emails, et cetera).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eContact appropriate law enforcement (I contacted the FBI because it appeared to be an international issue, and was at the very least an interstate issue because Escrow.com is located in California, and I’m in New York).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote: Every situation is different, and I can’t wholeheartedly recommend the steps that I took that ultimately resulted in me regaining control over my domain name largely because they involved interacting with criminals. Obviously that isn’t ideal, and can have unpredictable consequences. (Although my husband says that he would like it to be known that he thinks I’m a huge badass. While this is ordinarily very far from the truth, in this specific instance…I’ll take it.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe End. (That was long. Thanks for reading.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e*ICann.Org is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS). ICANN’s policy on Domain Name Dispute Resolution essentially states that in the case of a domain dispute, the Losing Registrar (the registrar that maintained possession of the domain name pre-transfer, as opposed to the “Winning Registrar”, who maintains possession of the domain name post-transfer). must immediately establish a Transfer Emergency Action Contact (“TEAC“) in an effort to get the ball rolling in the direction of resolution right away). Once I had this information, my case was immediately upgraded.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e**TEAC: A contact that is established by ICANN and used by other registrars and ICANN if there is a need to quickly address issues with domain transfers between two registrars. The contact must respond to inquiries within four hours, though final resolution may take longer.\u003c/p\u003e",

I wrote this guide because I want to help others with non-traditional backgrounds succeed on take-home coding challenges. Please read it, take notes, apply the material, and let me know about your results. You can reach me via email at jane@fullstackinterviewing.com.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis guide is intended for anyone who has received a take-home coding challenge as part of the technical interview process and wants to attack it in the best way. This Essential Guide is a distilled version of a longer Ultimate Guide to Take-home Coding Challenges, which goes into much more detail and walks through an example challenge from start to finish.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, if you’ve just received a challenge and are anxious to get started, start here, and then check out the full guide when you want to learn the material more deeply. Good luck!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMistakes to avoid making when working on a take-home coding challenge\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are several mistakes you can make with take-home challenges. Some of these are small mistakes that are easily correctable, while others will leave you frustrated and unable to finish your assignment. I want to address these mistakes first, so when you’re given a take-home challenge, you know exactly what not to do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are four mistakes you can make:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Time management and scope creep\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Trying to learn too many new things at once\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Making too many assumptions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Starting to code right away\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s look at each one in detail.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Time management and scope creep\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTime estimation is one of the hardest problems in programming, and even experienced engineers struggle with it. This plays into take-home challenges in a couple of ways.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, some challenges come with “estimated time.” I usually ignore these, as they are rarely based in reality. Second, some challenges are open-ended. Many people, especially newer developers, will want to add tons of features because they think it will be impressive. Actually, it’s more impressive if you keep the scope relatively narrow, but finish everything you set out to do. In this situation, it’s better to do one thing really well than to do a million things poorly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA good question would be: what counts as “going above and beyond” versus what counts as “scope creep?” My rule of thumb would be if your idea accomplishes or improves on the requirements of the assignment, that is likely a good idea, but if it seems tangentially related or “just cool,” it’s probably scope creep. But, as I describe later, always make it work first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Trying to learn too many new things at once\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile a take-home coding challenge can be an excellent opportunity for learning, it is possible to take on too much learning. If you’re given a challenge where you must use a specific language or framework, but you’re not familiar with it, don’t add additional complexity by setting out to learn something new on top of that. For example, if you are using a new backend framework for a full stack app, stick to a frontend framework that you’re already comfortable with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf your challenge is language/framework agnostic, but you’ve been itching to try out some new technology, pick JUST ONE to experiment with. Between reading the docs, getting your challenge properly set up, and getting used to any new syntax, you will have your hands full. Even learning one thing will eat up a lot of your time, so I would highly suggest limiting yourself to one new piece of technology per challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Making too many assumptions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a developer, if you make too many assumptions, you are bound to build an application where the requirements are off, or the user experience is bad. When given a set of requirements for a take-home challenge, ALWAYS take the time to review the requirements and make sure you fully understand them. And, if you have any questions at all, always ask.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, this shows that you are willing to ask for help when you don’t quite understand something, an important trait for a developer to demonstrate. Second, many companies will intentionally give you product requirements that are vague or not fully fleshed out in order to see how you react in these situations. They are actually testing your ability to make sense of requirements that may have gaps in them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, when in doubt, ask questions. Asking questions is also a signal that you are engaged and interested in the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Starting to code right away\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne last mistake you can make is to jump in and start coding right away. I guarantee if you do this, you will regret it. Why? Two reasons:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWithout proper planning, your code will suffer\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWithout first getting organized and making sure you fully understand ALL of the technical requirements, you may find yourself missing edge cases or rewriting parts of the functionality. I know it seems counter-intuitive, but you will actually SAVE yourself time if you plan ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou will spin your wheels trying to get your app set up properly\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEspecially for newer developers, initial app setup can be one of the hardest parts of a take-home coding challenge. It’s not something you do every day, so it often takes some research and reading documentation to get reacquainted with the process and ensure you’re going about it in the best way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, there you have it — a summary of mistakes to avoid making. You’ll find that a lot of these are also applicable to your day to day work as a developer. In the next section, we’ll dive into further detail on how to get organized before you write a single line of code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet organized: how to plan before you write a line of code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow it’s time to get to work! But, it’s NOT time to write any code YET.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause, as you’ll see, a lot of the work actually happens before you write a single line of code. This may seem counterintuitive, but again — the more time you spend up front planning, the less time you will spend writing code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, now you have your coding challenge in hand and you are ready to get started with the planning process. Here are my six suggested steps:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Understand the requirements and ask any questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Identify technical decisions you need to make\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Technical design \u0026 whiteboarding\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. App setup plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. Organize your tasks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Understand the requirements and ask any questions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, you need to make sure you completely, absolutely, 100% understand the requirements of the project. If any part of the requirements are unclear, it is up to you to reach out to your contact and ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSometimes companies will purposefully make their requirements vague, in order to see how you approach the problem. In these cases, it is always best to ask questions as it shows you are thinking about the problem and not just making assumptions and building an app to a vague spec.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Identify technical decisions you need to make\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour next step will be to identify the technical decisions that you need to make. Making a list of all of your technical decisions up front and thinking about them before you’re in the middle of building your app will help you immensely. Not only will it cut down on time figuring things out later, but it will allow you to make big picture decisions up front, as opposed to trying to focus on both the big picture and the small details at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Technical design \u0026 whiteboarding\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow it’s time to plan out the rest of your app. For anything that you need to draw out, now is the perfect time to do that. Thinking through these decisions at the start serves two purposes:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ll be able to reference these drawings and your original plan while you’re building your app. Then if you get stuck at any point, you can always come back to your notes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, when you are having a discussion with an engineer about your coding challenge, you can use these notes as a reference when they ask you why you made certain design or architecture decisions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve thought through and answered some of the bigger design and architecture questions for your challenge, the next step is research. If you’re planning to use a new technology or something you’re a bit rusty with, use this time to search for documentation and other resources.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnother very important step to take before writing a line of code is developing a test plan. Although you won’t get peer feedback on this test plan, it will help you look at the challenge from a different angle, making sure you’re meeting all of the requirements. By thinking through and writing out a test plan before you start coding, you are able to brainstorm possible edge cases that you should account for in your code and you will use this as a basis for testing your app later.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. App setup plan\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re starting an app from scratch, figure out if there are any generators you can use to make your app setup easier and faster. Application setup is one of the hardest parts of take-home coding challenges, because it’s something that developers do rather infrequently. Best practices are always changing, so it’s easy to forget how to do. Also, when setting up an app with a specific combination of technologies for the first time, it can be challenging to get everything configured and working together properly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you are not using a generator, reading documentation and finding working examples are the two most important steps you can take. Being able to play with a working example and compare it to your own app will help you if you get stuck.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. Organize your tasks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe last step before you start coding is to break down and organize your tasks. Breaking down your tasks is essential because it will help you stay on track as you’re working on your challenge, and it will give you a game plan for execution. Note that you shouldn’t be a perfectionist here, because there will always be unexpected bumps in the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is an example task list for a classic Tic Tac Toe app:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Understand requirements\u003cbr /\u003e - Choose technologies\u003cbr /\u003e - Brainstorm test plan\u003cbr /\u003e - Hello World app setup\u003cbr /\u003e - Build board with HTML/CSS\u003cbr /\u003e - Implement Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript\u003cbr /\u003e - Add reset button\u003cbr /\u003e - Make board responsive\u003cbr /\u003e - Add ability to add additional boards\u003cbr /\u003e - Error handling \u0026 tests\u003cbr /\u003e - Code cleanup\u003cbr /\u003e - README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome of these tasks can be broken down even further into smaller steps. For example, in order to implement the Tic Tac Toe gameplay with Javascript, here are some smaller tasks:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Add a click handler to each square that logs a message\u003cbr /\u003e - Get click handler to add an X to the square that is clicked\u003cbr /\u003e - Get clicks to alternate between X and O\u003cbr /\u003e - Don’t allow a square to be clicked more than once\u003cbr /\u003e - Implement a function to find the winner and end the game\u003cbr /\u003e - Handle a tie game\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Writing tests: just do it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTesting can be overwhelming, because there are so many different types of tests: acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests, not to mention test driven development vs. ad hoc testing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy should you include tests in your take-home coding challenge? It’s simple: your tests will make your submission shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, adding tests shows that you know or are willing to learn another technology/framework. It also demonstrates that you take ownership of what you’re building, because you are taking responsibility to make sure it works. Testing also shows that you’ve considered edge cases, which many newer engineers often overlook.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany companies take tests very seriously. Some will not tell you that they expect tests for your coding challenge, but will automatically reject you if you leave them out. Therefore, my recommendation is to write tests no matter what when given a take-home challenge. Not only will it make you a better developer, but for companies that were not expecting tests, you will stand out even more!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow do you go about writing a tests? First, create a plan. Here’s my 80/20 suggestion for how to come up with the right test cases:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Test the happy path\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the classic Tic Tac Toe example, the happy path is starting with an empty board and playing a game until X wins.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Think about variations on the happy path\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA variation on the happy path would be if O wins, or if there is a tie game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Think of edge cases\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn edge case would be if a player tries to play a move in the same square more than once.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Test anything that is complex\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe algorithm to find the winner is the most complex part of this example.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s a sample test plan:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e- Test that the initial state of the board is correct (i.e. board is\u003cbr /\u003e visible and empty)\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a move can be played\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that moves alternate between X and O\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a move can be played to a square only once\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a row\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a column\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a winner can be found in a diagonal\u003cbr /\u003e - Test that a draw can be found\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, now it’s your turn. Think about your app and, as a baseline, think of 5–10 tests that you can write.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Make it work, then make it pretty, then make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe title of this section sums it up pretty well, but when you’re working on building out your challenge, you should follow these 3 steps IN THIS ORDER:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Make it work\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make it pretty\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Make it work\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you’re given a take-home coding challenge, no matter what you do, the most crucial part of the challenge is to make it work. If you submit an app that has a nice UI, that will not matter if your app does not work or meet all of the requirements. Because building features to spec is a key aspect of your future job as a developer, you first and foremost need to focus on the functionality of your app and prioritize that above all else.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is also key if you are low on or run out of time. Coding challenges can be a lot of work, especially if you want to go above and beyond to ensure that you make it to the next interview round. But, I can guarantee that you will not make it to the next round if your app doesn’t function properly or is missing some key components.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, if you’re building a front-end app, this means focusing on making it work first, and styling/UI last. If you are building a back-end or full-stack app, focus on making it work before trying to refactor your code into the most elegant solution, and only then worry about optimization.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven if you end up without any time to go back and refactor your code or style your UI, having a working app to present is more important. You can always talk to the interviewer about how you would improve your app, and refactoring some of your code might even be part of the next round of interviewing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make it pretty\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMake it pretty has two interpretations here. One is making the code pretty, and the other is making the UI pretty. Making the code pretty can be done in several ways. First, ensure indentation is consistent and your code is readable. Second, if you got something to work in a quick, hacky way, think about how you can refactor it to be a more elegant solution without overcomplicating it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re doing a front-end or full-stack challenge, you can also make the UI pretty as part of this step. Whether you use a library or write your own custom styles for your app, making the UI look good will show your interviewer that you’re taking the user experience into consideration when building a feature.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor some more front-end-focused challenges, you’ll be given a specific mockup to match. In these cases, making sure you’re detail oriented down to the last pixel is incredibly important. Part of your role may involve translating mockups from designers into user interfaces, so companies want to get a sense of how you approach those types of tasks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Make it fast\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve made your app work, made it pretty (in the code, UI, or both), it may be time to make it fast! This is where understanding performance and BigO notation comes in handy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou should take a look at your code and see if there are any areas where increasing the scale might be an issue. For example, are you using a double for loop somewhere? What if the arrays you’re looping over become super long?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you think about these kinds of edge cases, you can then come up with plan to improve your code. Taking something that would have been running O(n) and making it O(1) will show that you’re thinking about performance when you’re building things.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to make your code shine\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen given a take-home coding challenge, many people think about how to build an app that works, but stop there. In this section, I’ll go over things an engineer reviewing your code will look for, so you can take your challenge to the next level and make your code shine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen an engineer is reviewing your code, they will look for several different things. They will likely try to run your app to play around with it and see it working. After that, they will delve into the actual code, looking to see how you organized your app architecture and reading code in individual files.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are several things you can do to make your code stand out. You want your code to be:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReadable\u003cbr /\u003e Easy to follow\u003cbr /\u003e Well organized\u003cbr /\u003e Clean (properly indented, free of syntax errors and unnecessary whitespace)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are the basics that don’t take much effort outside of mindfulness to get right. Now let’s talk about three of the more involved code style considerations:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. How to name things\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How to use comments effectively\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. How to format your code as you write it\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. How to name things\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNaming is one of the hardest problems in programming. One of the keys to naming things is to make sure you’re naming them in a way that another developer who is unfamiliar with the code can easily jump in and understand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor functions, think about what exactly the function is doing. Is the function checking whether there is a winner on a row of a Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be checkRow. Is your function handling a click on a square of the Tic Tac Toe board? Then a great name would be handleClick.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne quick tip: if you find yourself losing your flow because you keep stopping to think of the perfect name, split your process into two steps. First, write working code with any names (like foo, bar, and baz). Then take a second pass through to improve them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How to use comments effectively\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdding comments can be a great way to capture what you were thinking at the time you wrote a specific piece of code. This can be useful to you, or anyone else who comes across your code in the future and needs to understand it, tweak it, or rewrite it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThink of comments as adding clarity to your code. But, pay attention, because there is such a thing as too many comments.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere is where you most likely do not need comments:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you declare a variable\u003cbr /\u003e When you declare a function\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe variable or function name should be enough to explain exactly what it does. If you need a comment to explain it, then you need to give it a better name!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of where comments can be useful:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHTML\u003cbr /\u003e CSS\u003cbr /\u003e Technically tricky lines of code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s talk about HTML. Markup seems pretty self-explanatory, right? So, why would you need comments? Let’s say you have a really long HTML file with A LOT of \u003cdiv\u003es. Comments can be a good way to signal which \u003c/div\u003e tags close which sections.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn CSS, comments are a good way to divide up your styles if you have a lot of styles in one file. This way, when you come back to the code later and want to make a change, it’s easier to find the styles for that one section you need to update.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eComments in CSS are also very useful whenever you are hard-coding any math or adding an arbitrary number of pixels as margin, padding, and so on. Comments can be useful to explain things like this that are specific to your application.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the best uses for comments is when you’ve written code that is technically difficult or just not intuitive. You should always strive for simple, understandable code as much as possible. However, sometimes you will have confusing code — maybe you’ve chained a bunch of methods together or are using a complex regular expression — and it would help to explain what is happening in a comment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou are almost done learning how to make your code shine! Just one more step.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. How to format your code as you write it\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m a STICKLER about formatting when it comes to code. And, it’s not just me. You’ll find that the best engineers also care about well-formatted, clean code. Why? First, it’s much easier to read! Coding can be really challenging, so when code is easier to read, it makes our jobs as developers that much easier. Also, writing clean code sends a message to your interviewers that you take pride in the craft of writing code, and for many teams, this is a big deal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, how do you make sure the code style sticklers will approve of your code? There are a few simple tricks you can use as you’re working through your coding challenge to ensure the end result comes out clean and you don’t have to spend time at the end reformatting everything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eChoose tabs or spaces and be consistent across your entire application (i.e. no 2 spaces in some files, 4 spaces in others)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndent your code properly as you go so that it stays readable and isn’t all over the place\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet rid of trailing whitespace! Whitespace can sometimes wreck havoc, so it’s best to just get rid of it as you write your code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKeep your syntax consistent throughout your entire app. If you’re using a linter, this will be easier, but requires setting one up. If you don’t have time to set one up, pay attention. Don’t use ES5 in some places in your app and ES6 in others. Pick one and stick with it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemove unnecessary logging and debug statements when you’re done using them! Unless logging is part of your application, you’ll want to remove any temporary statements you were using while building your app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlways leave a newline at the end of every file\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s it! It’s pretty simple, and once you’re in the habit of doing this, not only will your code be easier for you to read, but it will also be easier for others to read and maintain. Many new developers haven’t been exposed to very much code maintenance, but trust me, when you have to clean up code someone else has written, you will be more thankful if it was neatly organized to start. Pay it forward!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to take your challenge to the next level\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are 3 ideas for how you can take your coding challenge to the next level:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Bonuses\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. UI/UX design (for front-end or full-stack challenges)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Data validation and error handling\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Bonuses\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNot all coding challenges come with bonuses, but if yours does and your goal is to get a job offer, do them! Why? It’s pretty simple. If you go above and beyond in your coding challenge, it will show that you will go above and beyond once you’re hired at this company. Completing bonus requirements is a high competence trigger for the interviewer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. UI/UX design (for front-end or full-stack challenges)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome front-end or full-stack challenges will mention UI/UX design as a bonus, but if they don’t, putting in some effort to make the UI look nice and be easy to use will go a long way. You can either go the route of adding your own custom CSS or plugging in a library or two to help make your styling even more painless. If you use a library, just make sure that you understand how it works enough to explain how you’ve used it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Data validation and error handling\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eData validation and error handling are key components in production apps. Adding either one of these (or both!) to your challenge will help make it stand out. Many developers who are new to coding and haven’t worked in a production codebase before don’t have a ton of exposure to either of these, so if you add error handling for edge cases it will show that you thought through a lot of different situations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to write an awesome README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may be done writing code, but you’re not done writing yet — it’s time to write your README.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy you should include a README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eREADMEs are incredibly important, both for professional developers and for job seekers working on take-home challenges. Including a README shows that you care about documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDocumentation helps spread knowledge across teams and serves as a supplement to your code. Having documentation for your take-home challenge ensures that anyone else (or future you) can jump into your code with a clear understanding of what you’ve built without any guessing games.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour README is also the KEY to making sure that everyone reviewing your challenge has the most painless experience possible. Finally, your README is a way of proving to your reviewer that you successfully met the requirements of the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to write your README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWriting a great README is not hard, and you will stand out a great deal from the other applicants with one. Here are the five sections I’d recommend you include:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Installation instructions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Discussion of technologies used\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. A section demonstrating that you met the requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Installation instructions\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen writing your README, don’t make any assumptions. Write out all of the steps to run your app locally and test them yourself. This includes cloning the repo from Github, running installation commands, and starting up a server. Also, make sure to include versions of software that you are using. This will ensure that the developer reviewing your code has a seamless experience setting up and running your app, and if they do happen to run into any trouble due to versioning, they will have all of the information they need right there in the README.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Discussion of technologies used\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis section is as simple as it sounds — make a list of all of the technologies you used including frameworks and libraries. If you had to find a library for a specific piece of functionality in your take-home challenge, mention it here and include a link to the docs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. A section demonstrating that you met the requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUsually your take-home challenge will come with some sort of requirements spec, so make sure to include a section in your README where you describe the requirements and how you met them. In some cases, you can take the product spec you were given and write a short explanation of how you met each requirement in a list. In other cases, you can simply include a short paragraph explaining how you satisfied the requirements. It’s totally up to you how you do it, just make sure you include it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. If there are bonuses, a section demonstrating that you met them\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSimilar to the requirements section above, you’ll want to highlight any bonuses you completed while working on the take-home challenge. If you attempted a bonus, but couldn’t quite get something to work, then the README is also a good place to address that. You can discuss the approach or approaches you tried and what worked or didn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. For algorithms and data structures, time and space complexity\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you had to write any algorithms or data structures as part of your take-home challenge, it’s helpful to include the space-time complexity of your final algorithm. This can be done in Big O notation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne final word of advice: write your README in markdown so it looks nice! This will demonstrate that you know (or are willing to learn) another language that will come in handy as a full-time developer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinal steps before you hit send\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow that you’ve written your README, you’re almost ready to hit send! Before you do that, take the time to double check all of your work using the following checklist:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRe-read the take-home challenge instructions to make sure you didn’t miss any requirements\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eReview your app’s code to ensure that it shines\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRun your app’s automated tests and make sure they are all passing\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTest your app manually and make sure everything is working properly\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTest your app installation instructions from your README\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStart an email draft and copy your README into it for convenience\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf requested, make sure to attach a zip file of your code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWrite an email to your contact at the company\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour email can be short and sweet — I always like to highlight something I enjoyed about the challenge or something I learned. Here’s an example:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHi \u003cNAME\u003e,\u003cbr /\u003e I hope you had a great week! I had fun diving back into React with this challenge. Here is my Github repo and I’ve included my README below. Please let me know if you have any questions.\u003cbr /\u003e Just so you know, I’m interviewing with a few other companies and I just received an offer yesterday — I need to get back to them next week. Of course, I am excited about the opportunity at \u003cCOMPANY NAME\u003e, so I’m looking forward to hearing from you!\u003cbr /\u003e Thanks,\u003cbr /\u003e \u003cNAME\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote that you should only mention interviewing with other companies or offer deadlines if either is actually the case. I feel you should be honest and candid about your situation and maintain leverage for a potential future compensation negotiation at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow, finally, hit send!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope this Essential Guide was helpful and you learned something that you can apply to a take-home challenge or in your day-to-day work.

I can’t keep on doing something simply for the fun of it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat I work on during my off time has to have some economic upside for me.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOK, coding pays. It can pay big. So what’s the problem?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, before I could fully embrace myself as a 56-year-old programming rookie, I had to deal with my Critical Inner Self (let’s call him CIS for short).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearning all this stuff is hard enough without my CIS whispering in my ear the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf I can give my CIS an epic beat-down, then I should be able to handle anyone who appears to work on his behalf. And these agents of CIS often appear out of no where, asking critical questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Why are you doing this at your age?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: What you really mean is how much longer will I live. And do I really have enough time left to make money programming. Let’s break that down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m an American. My life expectancy is 78.8 years. So that means I’ve got a better than average chance of living another 22.8 years. That may not seem like a lot when you’re 20, but I’m 56 and dancing in the street over here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e(And because I’m 56, I’ve got better odds of making it to 78 than a 20 year old. But that’s beside the point.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow, let’s say I’m a snail and it takes me 4 years to finish Free Code Camp’s 1-year curriculum to become a fledgling full stack developer. That puts me at 60 years old looking for a job as a junior developer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say it takes me another 2 years to land a job because of my age, and let’s assume that 70 is the limit for how long an employer wants me hanging around.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s 8 years to practice my craft. That’s plenty of runway to get pretty good. And because I’ve been around the block and know the grass ain’t always greener on the other side, I’m much more likely to stay with that employer who hired me first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat 20-year-old stays with their first developer job that long?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: But who’s going to pay you the kind of money that you already make now?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: You could ask me that even if I didn’t learn to program. But I know what you’re getting at. Chances are an entry level developer job will pay me less than I’m making now.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell here’s a thought for you. My paycheck is less today than it was five years ago. And that’s with 5 more years of experience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere’s no guarantee that the job I have now will last. And when it doesn’t, I’ll have to find a new job anyway. At my age, I very well may have to accept entry level wages doing something… anything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’d rather have the skills and portfolio to go for an entry level position that can lead to much greater earnings — or at least the ability to beat the bushes and pick up some freelance work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: But all the big tech companies want to hire young kids right out of college.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: That’s easy. I don’t want to move to Silicon Valley and I’m not looking to work for a big tech company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ve read the same stats as me. By 2020 there will be 1,000,000 more programming jobs than people trained to fill them. Not all of those openings will be at the “big 4” — Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft. In fact, most programming jobs aren’t even in the technology industry.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy first computer job was in a hospital. I didn’t program, but most of the employees in the IT department were programmers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd that was way back in 1982.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Then how are you going to get a job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: First things first, I’m going to apply to a lot of jobs, build a network of hiring managers, and make sure I get a lot of interviews. It’s a numbers game and I’m going to play it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll that wonderful stuff I did before the year 2000? Gone from my resume.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce I’m in the door for an interview, it’s not like I’m going to act like someone’s grandfather. I’ll be just another candidate who’s passionate about programming and excited to learn more. And I won’t act like I know more than I do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd most importantly, I’ll be prepared for common coding challenges and whiteboard interview questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m sure I’ll mess up a few interviews. But the good news? There are plenty of companies out there hiring developers. I’ll keep trying.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: Programming teams are full of young people. How are you going to fit in?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: If by “fit in” you mean how do I become one of the bros? In that case, you’re right. I won’t fit in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt my current job, I show up every day knowing that somebody at work has something to teach me. So I listen. I don’t presume to know everything that’s going on in my boss’s day, so I give him a break. And when I mess up, I say so.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat’s how I’ve fit in at every job I’ve had over the last 36 years.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: You’ve got a decent job. Why not just accept it? You are where you’re going to be, especially at your age.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: Accept it? Too late. I’ve already re-framed it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearning to program energizes me. Working toward a second career gives me the boost I need to get through the daily slog of the one I’ve got now.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd really? You know where I’m going to be at 60, 70, and (hopefully) beyond? I sure don’t.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCIS: How do you know you’re not just wasting time?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMe: What you’re really asking is: “What if you don’t get a 9-to-5 paycheck after this?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy answer: “So what?”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI can get good enough, in time enough, to program well enough:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eto build web apps to build an audience…and offer them even more value from my billable services.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eto grow a web business helping local businesses grow and nurture their own customers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eto combine my programming know-how with existing SaaS APIs to offer a productized service to a niche community.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo put it another way, I can learn how to build an idea. To put it out there for people to use. To offer value. To make money.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith or without a 9-to-5 J.O.B.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo that’s why even though I’m 56, I’m learning to code.\u003c/p\u003e",

It's more attainable than you think, because it's all about process.

In particular, non-technical leaders have earned a poor reputation with software developers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOffice Space depicts the non-technical manager in Bill Lumbergh, pictured above. Dilbert provides the classic “Pointy-Haired Boss.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis article is for anyone who wants to effectively orchestrate a development process without becoming the butt of your team’s water-cooler jokes. I’ll share what I’ve learned over the years managing development and release processes as a manager and software architect at UCLA and Stanford University.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe biggest lesson I’ve learned is that the key to sustaining successful software releases is completely non-technical.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s about process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome aspects of a development process benefit from technical know-how, but it’s not required. Successfully releasing software into production is much more a question of robust process architecture than design or code alone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor the purpose of this article, we’ll assume you’ve already agreed to start building something. The product approval pipeline is a different process. Today we’re focusing on getting the agreed-upon product from concept to production.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat to build\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour team needs to assemble a clear roadmap for their code. Architects and manufacturers use blueprints. You should too.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour roadmap should include a set of schematics which each fulfill a different purpose. These schematics differ for individual applications. A user-interface mock-up, application architecture diagram, and business process model are common. More detailed component diagrams such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flow models are often useful as well.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTechnical expertise lets you use these schematics to critique your team’s architecture and ensure they’re on the right track. Even without technical skill, these schematics will be critical.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can use them to drive productive conversations about product completion. No more will you have to draw a “% complete” out of thin air or best-guess from the development team. You can track the status of each item on the diagram to determine how close the app is to completion. You can also project future velocity based on how quickly the team completed prior components.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is no “right” amount of pre-development documentation, but there is one wrong amount: none. Work out with your team what constitutes an acceptable roadmap before they start coding. The first checkpoint in your development process will be to review this documentation and ensure they’ve met this agreement.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat not to build\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour team can’t build everything. Nor should they. You need to ensure that your developers have a laser focus on what they actually need to build.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy are you building this app in the first place? Define the key differentiation from existing products. 80% of your team’s time should go toward supporting that differentiation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe schematics you should now have will be helpful here. Does your application include a logging component? A sign-up and login process? There are already excellent free, open-source software (FOSS) frameworks in most languages for these components. Some are available under extremely permissive licenses.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTesla provides a great illustration of this concept. Their first key differentiator was to use a lithium-ion battery to make electric cars competitive with gas. Lithium-ion achieved this by reducing battery weight and increasing range.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first Tesla prototype simply converted a pre-existing electric sports car from lead-acid to lithium batteries. Their first production run was mostly a Lotus Elise roadster (a pre-existing sports car) that had a Tesla battery and motor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe lesson for your team is to use what already exists wherever possible. If you can use or adapt a FOSS package, do it. Even if you need to license for-pay code from somewhere else, it’s almost always worth it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGet all the scaffolding in place quickly so you can test your “lithium-ion battery.” Then you can iterate through and replace whatever will help further differentiate your product without stressing about delaying production-readiness.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe second checkpoint of your development process is to review the planned architecture with your team and identify what very limited part they intend to build from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf it sounds like something that already exists, and it’s not the core focus of your product, challenge your team to see why they believe they need to re-do it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t just throw it over the wall\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you have identified what pre-built technologies you’ll use, make sure to review these with your production support group.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDatabase and server administrators will need to plan for installing and supporting any new technologies. This is the third checkpoint in your development process: operations readiness.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKeeping the production support team in the loop early is 90% of the secret sauce known as “DevOps.” If you haven’t heard of this, DevOps is the idea that software development and production operations teams should unify under common goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe proposed benefits include much quicker releases, more reliable code, and more time spent developing due to automation. These are all great boons, but they follow from a strong communication process. Automation follows, not replaces, collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eImplementation and Testing\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow your team writes the code. Collaborate with your implementation team to devise a process for dividing the work among themselves. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, and this is where the “soft skills” of leadership dramatically outweigh any technical skill.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome developers will want to hog all the “interesting” work and ignore any drudge work. They may believe that they’re the smartest person in the room and should get their pick of assignments. Others may resist change and only want to do the same kind of work they’ve done before.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLead your team into an equitable distribution of work. Challenge everyone to grow appropriately and to share and collaborate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne more technical aspect of the implementation is that the code must include sufficient automated tests. These are code-defined tests that a test system can execute.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf the code’s going to crash, don’t you want these guys’ resumes to be on the line instead of your own? (public domain: US Government photo)\u003cbr /\u003e Manual “test scripts” where a human interacts with the code to see if it works are insufficient and reflect technical debt. Your technical team should at least include unit tests. Test-driven development is a popular approach for ensuring that critical code is always tested.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can drive a non-technical conversation with your team about their “test coverage” (the portion of the code that is tested). It’s pretty simple: ask them to list their assumptions. Then ask where and how they test these assumptions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe checkpoint at which the code is believed complete by the developers is referred to in my shop as dev-complete. It means the primary development (dev) process is over, but additional code may be written to address issues that come up in the review process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn an agile development process, you will typically divide the implementation process into multiple checkpoints instead of one all-or-nothing deadline. These are typically called iterations.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRefer to the roadmap you defined in the first step. Before starting new component(s), ensure that what you’ve already started is at least dev-complete. This provides you with an accurate view of the speed of development and reduces risk.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you complete the iterations, you can push the code to an environment for “acceptance testing.” This involves pilot or test users (or an internal team playing that role) who interact with the partial product. They test to ensure it meets the design expectations and provide feedback on how it could be better.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAcceptance testing is not a substitute for the unit testing mentioned earlier. It serves a different purpose. Letting your development team lean on acceptance testing to catch basic functional bugs is a recipe for disaster.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFeedback from the acceptance testers can be incorporated into the next iteration. This is another good reason not to bite off a big chunk of the product all at once. You want to leave room to change course once people start playing with the product.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve accumulated enough tested code to constitute a sufficient product release, you’re ready to begin the release management process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLooking for bugs in all the right places\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour developer or team has reached a point where they believe the code is done. Acceptance testers are satisfied with the way the product is working. The next checkpoint in the process is to validate the belief that you have code ready to become a product. Let’s start reviewing the code!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may not be comfortable or have sufficient technical know-how to review the team’s code yourself. That’s ok! You don’t have to. Your process has to.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWork with your team to identify a process for code review that works for them. If you have more than one developer, peer code review works great. If you don’t, are there other developers in your organization outside of your team? Work across team boundaries to establish a peer code review program.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf there really is only one developer, then sit down with them and have them walk you through the code. Use your schematics as a reference point, and ask them to tell you how the code accomplishes the schematic’s goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the conclusion of the code review process, the developer and reviewer(s) should feel comfortable with being held accountable for the code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe code review is also a good time for reviewing two other critical points: documentation and security.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve already written about a sustainable documentation architecture — check it out if you’re interested!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSecurity review should be a part of any code review. In general, this involves taking a second look at the code to spot weaknesses where an attacker could exploit it to reveal private data or gain control of the server. It must be done by a technical person.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a free comprehensive guide to security review.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYour developer can do this if they’re the only one on the team, even if they just run an automated security code analysis tool. There are free tools for helping with this process which are linked through the OWASP wiki.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEject, eject, eject!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe code has passed the review process. It’s ready to become a product. But that doesn’t mean it’s ready for production.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe last checkpoint to clear is deployment readiness. Is your code in a state where it’s easy to deploy to production? This should involve as few manual steps as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt also means you need to have a plan for reverting the change in case the code doesn’t work as planned. This is called a “rollback plan.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e If you have a separate software operations team, this is where they come back into the picture. They should review the deployment and rollback documentation and let you know if it’s sufficient.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have these personnel you can perform this step yourself. Make sure that there are clear, simple instructions for deploying the product. There should be very few manual steps, as each manual step introduces a chance for human error.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere should be a clear, sufficient plan for returning to the prior state of affairs if the deployment doesn’t succeed. This may be as simple as restoring a backup, or it may involve customer communication or data conversion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhether the plan is sufficient depends on how thoroughly your team tested the code, and how widely the product is being released. Consider also any risks associated with the product or with this particular release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve passed this checkpoint, push that code into production!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePost-release\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSucceed or fail, it’s important to circle back and review how the process went.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDid your team accurately estimate the effort required to release a product? Did the testing adequately model the production scenario? Revisit the implementation and testing checkpoints, and review how well the team performed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow is the product running in production? It’s a good idea to visit the operations staff and obtain their feedback. This further creates trust between the development and operations teams, and will lead to more DevOps benefits down the road.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhere are the remaining gaps in your product? If they’re in third-party code, now’s the time to consider whether to customize your packages or re-implement from scratch. Otherwise, you now have input on what to build for the next release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAbove all, hold yourself and your team accountable for the results of your effort.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccountability facilitates independence and promotes individual growth. As your team grows accustomed to being held accountable for each step in this process, they’ll adjust their performance accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to be the least bit technical to run a successful software release process. Technical skill can help, but it can also become a crutch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe key to successful software release is a well-documented, well-understood process for moving software through the pipeline from idea to product. You now have a starting point for drafting your own software release process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat’s most important is that you participate with your team in filling in the blanks and creating a repeatable process that works for all of you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t have to be perfect for anyone, but it does have to be understood by everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou also need to ensure that the velocity of your product through these checkpoints matches the demand for the product. None of these items need to be multi-day show-stoppers. It could be a simple one-page checklist. You need to define a process that fits your environment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs with any process, you should also iterate. Just like with the code, your first, untested draft isn’t likely to be perfect. Tune the process on each run-through and you’ll end up with a smooth, predictable software release path.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd remember to brush your hair. You don’t want it looking…pointy.\u003c/p\u003e",

If things go well, they can unlock the ability to participate in real, but still anonymous, interviews with top companies like Twitch, Lyft and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEarlier this year, we launched an offering specifically for university students. It was intended to help level the playing field right at the start of people’s careers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe problem\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s the sad truth: given the state of college recruiting today, if you haven’t attended one of a very few top schools, your chances of interacting with companies on campus are slim. It’s not fair, and it sucks, but university recruiting is still dominated by career fairs. Companies pragmatically choose to visit the same few schools every year. Despite the fact that the career fair is one of the most antiquated, biased forms of recruiting that there is, the format persists. This is likely because there doesn’t seem to be a better way to quickly connect with students at scale.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, despite the increasingly loud conversation about diversity, campus recruiting marches on, and companies keep doing the same thing expecting different results.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn a previous blog post, we explained why companies should stop courting students from the same five schools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRegardless of how important you think this idea is (for altruistic reasons, perhaps), you may still be skeptical about the value and practicality of broadening the college recruiting effort. You probably concede that it’s rational to visit top schools, given limited resources. Society is often willing to agree that there are perfectly qualified students coming out of non-top colleges, but they maintain that they’re relatively rare.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’re here to show you, with some nifty data from our university platform, that this is simply not true.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo be fair, this isn’t the first time we’ve looked at whether where you went to school matters. In a previous post, we found that taking Udacity and Coursera programming classes mattered way more than where you went to school. And way back in the day, one of our founders figured out that where you went to school didn’t matter at all — but that the number of typos and grammatical errors on your resume did.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, what’s different this time? The big, exciting difference is that these prior analyses were focused mostly on engineers who had been working for at least a few years already. This made it possible to argue that a few years of work experience smoothes out any performance disparity that comes from having attended (or not attended) a top school.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn fact, the good people at Google found that while GPA didn’t really matter after a few years of work, it did matter for college students. So, we wanted to face this question head-on and look specifically at college juniors and seniors while they were still in school. Even more pragmatically, we wanted to see if companies limiting their hiring efforts to just top schools were getting higher caliber candidates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore delving into the numbers, here’s a quick rundown of how our university platform works and what kind of data we collect.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe setup\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor students who want to practice on interviewing.io, the first step is a brief (~15-minute) coding assessment on Qualified to test basic programming competency. Students who pass this assessment (that is, those who are ready to code while another human being breathes down their necks) get to start booking practice interviews.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen an interviewer and an interviewee match on our platform, they meet in a collaborative coding environment with voice, text chat, and a whiteboard and jump right into a technical question. Interview questions on the platform tend to fall into the category of what you’d encounter during a phone screen for a back-end software engineering role. Interviewers typically come from top companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb, and more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter every interview, interviewers rate interviewees in a few different categories, including technical ability. Technical ability gets rated on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is “poor” and 4 is “amazing!” On our platform, a score of 3 or above has generally meant that the person was skilled enough to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn our platform, we’re fortunate to have thousands of students from all over the U.S., spanning over 200 universities. We thought this presented a unique opportunity to look at the relationship between school tier and interview performance for both juniors (interns) and seniors (new grads).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo study this relationship, we first split schools into the following four tiers, based on rankings from U.S. News \u0026 World Report:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Elite” schools (like MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, UC-Berkeley)\u003cbr /\u003e Top 15 schools (not including top tier, like University of Wisconsin, Cornell, Columbia)\u003cbr /\u003e Top 50 schools (not including top 15, like Ohio State University, NYU, Arizona State University)\u003cbr /\u003e The rest (like Michigan State, Vanderbilt University, Northeastern University, UC-Santa Barbara)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, we ran some statistical significance testing on interview scores vs. school tier to see if school tier mattered for both interns (college juniors) and new grads (college seniors). Our sample comprised a set of roughly 1,000 students.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDoes school have anything to do with interview performance?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the graphs below, you can see technical score distributions for interviews with students in each of the four school tiers (see legend). As you recall from above, each interview is scored on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is the worst and 4 is the best.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat’s pretty startling is that the shape of these distributions, for both juniors and seniors, is remarkably similar. Indeed, statistical significance testing revealed no difference between students of any tier when it came to interview performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJust to note: of course, this hinges on everyone completing a quick 15-minute coding challenge first, to ensure they’re ready for synchronous technical interviews. We’re excited about this because companies can replicate this step in their process as well!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat this means is that top-tier students are achieving the same results as those in “no-name” schools. So the question becomes: if the students are comparable in skill, why are companies spending egregious amounts of money attracting only a subset of them?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOkay, so what are companies missing?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBesides missing out on great, cheaper-to-acquire future employees, companies are missing out on an opportunity to save time and money. Right now, a ridiculous amount of money is being spent on university recruiting. We’ve previously cited the $18k price tag just for entry to the MIT career fair. In a study done by Lauren Rivera through the Harvard Business Review, she reveals that one firm budgeted nearly 1 million dollars just for social recruiting events on a single campus.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe higher price tag of these events also means that it makes even less sense for smaller companies or startups to try and compete with high-profile, high-profit tech giants. Most of the top schools that are being heavily pursued already have enough recruiters vying for their students. Unwittingly, this pursuit seems to run contrary to most companies’ desire for high diversity and long-term sustainable growth.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven when companies do believe that talent is evenly distributed across school tiers, there are still reasons why companies might recruit at top schools. There are other factors that help elevate certain schools in a recruiter’s mind. There are long-standing company-school relationships (for example, the number of alumni who work at the company currently). There are signaling effects, too — companies get Silicon Valley bonus points by saying their eng team is comprised of a bunch of ex-Stanford, ex-MIT ex-and so on students.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA quick word about selection bias\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince this post appeared on Hacker News, there’s been some loud, legitimate discussion about how the pool of students on interviewing.io may not be representative of the population at large. Indeed we do have a self-selected pool of students who decided to practice interviewing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCertainly, all the blog posts we publish are subject to this (very valid) line of criticism, as is this post in particular.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs such, selection bias in our user pool might mean that 1) we’re getting only the worst students from top schools (because, presumably, the best ones don’t need the practice), or 2) we’re getting only the best/most motivated students from non-top schools — or both.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAny subset of these results is entirely possible, but there are few reasons why we believe that what we’ve published here might hold truth regardless.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, in our experience, regardless of their background or pedigree, everyone is scared of technical interviewing. Case in point: before we started working on interviewing.io, we didn’t really have a product yet. So before investing a lot of time and heartache into this questionable undertaking, we wanted to test the waters to see if interview practice was something engineers really wanted — and more so, who these engineers that wanted practice were.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, we put up a pretty mediocre landing page on Hacker News…and got something like 7,000 signups on the first day. Of these 7,000 signups, roughly 25% were senior (4+ years of experience) engineers from companies like Google and Facebook. Now, this isn’t to say that they’re necessarily the best engineers out there, but it does suggest that the engineers the market seems to value the most still needed our services.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnother data point comes from one of our founders. Every year, Aline does a guest lecture on job search preparedness for a technical communication course at MIT. This course is one way to fulfill the computer science major communication requirement, so enrollment tends to span the gamut of computer science students. Before every lecture, she sends out a survey asking students what their biggest pain points are in preparing for their job search. Every year, trepidation about technical interviewing is either at the top of the list of 2nd from the top.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd though this doesn’t directly address the issue of whether we’re only getting the “best of the worst or the worst of the best” (and I hope the above has convinced you there’s more to it than that), here’s the distribution of school tiers among our users. I expect it mirrors the kinds of distributions companies see in their student applicant pool as well:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo what can companies do?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCompanies may never stop recruiting at top-tier schools entirely. But they ought to at least include schools outside of that very small circle in the search for future employees.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe end result of the data is the same: for good engineers, the school they attended means a lot less than we think. The time and money that companies spend to compete for candidates within the same select few schools would be better spent creating opportunities that include everyone. They could also develop tools to vet students more fairly and efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you saw above, we used a 15-minute coding assessment to cull our inbound student flow, and just a short challenge leveled the playing field between students from all walks of life. At the very least, we’d recommend employers do the same thing in their process. But, of course, we’d be remiss if we didn’t suggest one other thing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt interviewing.io, we’ve proudly built a platform that grants the best-performing students access to top employers, no matter where they went to school or where they come from. Our university program, in particular, allows us to grant companies the privilege to reach an exponentially larger pool of students, for the same cost of attending one or two career fairs at top target schools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWant diverse, top talent without the chase? Sign up to be an employer on our university platform!\u003c/p\u003e",

They create eponymous endowments or buildings and strive to protect the name their children will inherit.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s therefore striking that software developers have gotten their “legacy” so catastrophically wrong.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle “legacy,” and you’ll see the first definition matches what I’ve laid out for you here. It’s a definition that’s persisted since the 14th or 15th century.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe second definition provides a shocking contrast:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003elegacy. adjective (computing) “denoting software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDictionaries around the internet agree with this definition. It applies only to the field of computing. We developers have managed to invert the definition of our own legacy in the historical eye-blink that is computer science. That’s almost impressive!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you’re an experienced developer, you’ve certainly been tasked with supporting at least one legacy system in your career. For the uninitiated, well — buy a lot of caffeinated beverages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m about to relate to you the brief story of our toxic relationship with our legacy codebase. I’ll then describe how we broke up with it, and what we’ve changed to avoid falling back into bad relationships with high-maintenance code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Breakup\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt took eight months of seven-day weeks and twelve-hour days to complete our last legacy system overhaul.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur predecessors had pushed code into production for years without writing a single line of documentation. In fact, some of it wasn’t even in source control, as we later learned. But that’s another story.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m sure you’ve seen gems like this before:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e... hundreds of line of incomprehensible code\u003cbr /\u003e // TODO: Fix this bug!!!\u003cbr /\u003e ... hundreds more lines in the same method, no idea where or what the bug is\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThat is the approximate ratio and quality of the only documentation we had on the project.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wasn’t exposed to direct sunlight again until April, and I’d had enough. It was time for a break-up.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe importance of documentation\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn his book “The Art of Unit Testing,” Roy Osherove defines legacy code as any code that doesn’t have tests. He was an optimist. I more loosely regard as legacy any code which contains more technical debt than the time it took to write.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs our organization had, many development teams fall into the trap of instant-legacy code: code that already fits the “legacy code” label at the time of release.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn my experience, documentation is the most important aspect of avoiding such legacy code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have yet to meet a developer who loves the idea of documentation. On the other hand, I also have never met a developer who loves crawling inside the skull of a stranger to reverse-engineer a legacy implementation without any documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs they say, breaking up is hard to do. But in this case, I promise it will be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo let’s get started on converting your legacy into something you’ll be proud to bequeath to your successors. Let’s get documenting!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur approach: four layers of documentation\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe created, and began rigorously following, a four-layer architecture for documentation. We maintain three layers of persistent documentation for the project through its life-cycle. We also communicate through one layer of ephemeral documentation during our release management process.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe three persistent layers of documentation correlate to three different velocities in our development process. We include documentation review as part of code review to avoid falling back into bad habits.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e// The front lines: in-line comments keep maintainers sane\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe most granular tier of explicit documentation is in the code. We perform complete documentation of all classes and methods, their inputs, expected outputs, and exception pathways. We also document “unusual” code in-line.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a predominantly C# shop we use /// documentation ubiquitously. This decorates class, interface, and method declarations. The /// helper auto-generates XML stubs to document the nuts and bolts of the API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese pop up when your code is being referenced by an external project or DLL (dynamic-link library), provided that you’ve distributed the debugging files. Our IDE (integrated development environment) renders this as tool-tip help wherever a reference appears. This greatly aids developers, who are diving into our code for the first time, when trying to fix a bug or extend it for a new use case.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s worth researching your language and IDE of choice to learn how to extend it with contextual help for your libraries. If you’re not used to documenting your APIs, I suggest reading these articles to get started.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also include regular // comments beyond API documentation. We add these wherever the code is counter-intuitive, or if we’ve found a particularly elegant solution to a problem. We also use these to create “to-do’s” for later refactor when putting in a quick-and-dirty fix.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThese are invaluable to whoever has to come along and revert the change or fix the code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause it’s in-line with the source code, this documentation changes at the highest velocity — right along with the code it supports.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eREADME: making implementation a breeze\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use README files as an implementer’s guide. This documentation is for whoever will be consuming our libraries. It serves a secondary purpose as tactical-level documentation of the particulars of the implementation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use GitHub for source control, so we place readme.md (Markdown) files in each folder in our GitHub repository. GitHub very nicely renders Markdown files and automatically shows the rendered readme.md files in each folder. This results in a much more usable help file than a simple .txt document.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStoring this documentation in the code-base helps developers maintain the documentation. Anyone making a code change can easily open the .MD file in their source code editor or an online markdown editor, and immediately update the documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThus the source-controlled Markdown files live next to, but not within, the code they support. It’s also somewhat more “zoomed out” than inline comments. These two factors result in a lower velocity of updates on this documentation. Because you can still include it in the same commits it changes with higher velocity than offline documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe final advantage of this format is that anyone who downloads the source code has immediate access to the implementation guides. Coupled with the inline documentation, this provides both maintainers and consumers with sufficient documentation. They can develop a basic understanding of the project without jumping into another system, such as a wiki.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWiki: where business meets development\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe use the wiki-level documentation to marry the implementation to the business requirements. This documentation consists primarily of requirements, enterprise architecture diagrams and considerations, and tactical diagrams such as unified modeling language (UML) flow charts and class diagrams.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also use pages (on the same wiki) as meeting minutes, and to record decisions. We use a wiki which has versioning so that we can see a complete history of how requirements and designs have changed over time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe thereby ensure a complete history of the requirements process and how it relates to the changing architecture. Incidentally, GitHub also provides a wiki feature, but we use a third-party wiki which integrates with our project management software.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRelease management: commit and pull request comments\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur release management process includes code review. Our code review includes documentation review.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs GitHub is our source control platform, we bake code review into our pull requests. The platform supports commenting upon check-in, inline comment threads on portions of commits, and a conversation thread on the pull request.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe key to using these communication channels successfully is to ensure that all discussions result in a tangible output. Either clarify the code itself, or extend the permanent documentation in response to questions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf the reviewer doesn’t understand the code as it is written, future developers won’t either. Rewrite the code to be more self-explanatory, or extend the in-line or readme documentation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s not sufficient to end the conversation by replying to the thread: we treat this documentation as ephemeral, and on a long-lived code-base it’s a pain to review the full commit history.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBonus round: self-documenting code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinally, one quick plug for so-called “self-documenting code.” I’m a firm believer that the code should be self-explanatory at the surface. Explicit documentation should provide context or improve maintainability.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are already good articles about this (here’s one), so I won’t go into detail here.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFinal thoughts\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hope that you learn from our experience. Our four-layer documentation architecture may not work for you, but it’s important to figure out what will.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe big take-aways? First, it’s necessary to develop a healthy understanding of yourself and your own needs before you entangle yourself with a new code base.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSecond, it’s easier to stay out of a bad relationship with legacy code than to extract yourself once you’re already committed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnd third, you only leave one legacy. But every commit you make contributes to it. They won’t all be good, they won’t all be bad, but they should at least be clear. Please think about what you’re leaving for those who come after you.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTogether we can reclaim our legacy as developers.\u003c/p\u003e",

At some point or another, most large companies have built APIs for their customers, or for internal use.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut how do you explain API in plain English? And is there a broader meaning than the one used in development and business? First, let’s pull back and look at how the web itself works.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWWW and remote servers\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I think about the Web, I imagine a large network of connected servers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery page on the internet is stored somewhere on a remote server. A remote server is not so mystical after all — it’s just a part of a remotely located computer that is optimized to process requests.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo put things in perspective, you can spin up a server on your laptop capable of serving an entire website to the Web (in fact, a local server is what engineers use to develop websites before releasing them to the public).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen you type www.facebook.com into your browser, a request goes out to Facebook’s remote server. Once your browser receives the response, it interprets the code and displays the page.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo the browser, also known as the client, Facebook’s server is an API. This means that every time you visit a page on the Web, you interact with some remote server’s API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAPIs as a way to serve your customers\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou’ve probably heard of companies packaging APIs as products. For example, Weather Underground sells access to its weather data API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eExample scenario: Your small business’s website has a form used to sign clients up for appointments. You want to give your clients the ability to automatically create a Google calendar event with the details for that appointment.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAPI use: The idea is to have your website’s server talk directly to Google’s server with a request to create an event with the given details. Your server would then receive Google’s response, process it, and send back relevant information to the browser, such as a confirmation message to the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlternatively, your browser can often send an API request directly to Google’s server bypassing your server.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow is this Google Calendar’s API different from the API of any other remote server out there?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn technical terms, the difference is the format of the request and the response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo render the whole web page, your browser expects a response in HTML, which contains presentational code, while Google Calendar’s API call would just return the data — likely in a format like JSON.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf your website’s server is making the API request, then your website’s server is the client (similar to your browser being the client when you use it to navigate to a website).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom your users perspective, APIs allow them to complete the action without leaving your website.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost modern websites consume at least some third-party APIs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany problems already have a third-party solution, be it in the form of a library or service. It’s often just easier and more reliable to use an existing solution.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are commonly referred to as microservices.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo summarize, when a company offers an API to their customers, it just means that they’ve built a set of dedicated URLs that return pure data responses — meaning the responses won’t contain the kind of presentational overhead that you would expect in a graphical user interface like a website.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCan you make these requests with your browser? Often, yes. Since the actual HTTP transmission happens in text, your browser will always do the best it can to display the response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, you can access GitHub’s API directly with your browser without even needing an access token. Here’s the JSON response you get when you visit a GitHub user’s API route in your browser (https://api.github.com/users/petrgazarov).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe browser seems to have done just fine displaying a JSON response. A JSON response like this is ready for use in your code. It‘s easy to extract data from this text. Then you can do whatever you want with the data.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA is for “Application”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo close off, let’s throw in a couple more examples of APIs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Application” can refer to many things. Here are some of them in the context of API:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA piece of software with a distinct function.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe whole server, the whole app, or just a small part of an app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBasically any piece of software that can be distinctively separated from its environment, can be an “A” in API, and will probably also have some sort of API.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLet’s say you’re using a third-party library in your code. Once incorporated into your code, a library becomes part of your overall app. Being a distinct piece of software, the library would likely have an API which allows it to interact with the rest of your code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere’s another example: In Object Oriented Design, code is organized into objects. Your application may have hundreds of objects defined that can interact with one another.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEach object has an API — a set of public methods and properties that it uses to interact with other objects in your application.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn object may also have inner logic that is private, meaning that it’s hidden from the outside scope (and not an API).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom what we have covered, I hope you take away the broader meaning of API as well as the more common uses of the term today.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

Add in a full-time job and a couple of kids and the task seems nearly impossible. Yet, even if you are busy, you can prioritize and make the time to focus on what matters to you and build the skills to level up your career.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEngineer your future with code\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI started my coding journey just six months ago. Now I am one project away from completing my front-end developer certificate on freeCodeCamp. I’ve also completed the web developer boot camp course by Colt Steele on Udemy. And I did this all while raising two kids and working in a full-time job.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I began using these tips, I saw my progress increase tenfold. I know I would have accomplished much more if I had implemented them earlier in my journey. I have not only benefited from increased productivity, but I feel more balanced and am having more fun than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy pivot into web development\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter being in health care for the last five years, I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Don’t get me wrong - I loved helping people on their path to health, but I hated seeing the system break down for them. I hated when people could not afford their medication, or when their care plan wasn’t in sync with the treatment they needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wanted to do more to help these people. But I knew that I couldn’t do more unless I took a step back and looked at the bigger picture.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was not always interested in coding, but the more I looked at the forces making real change in today’s world, the more I saw that tech was behind these advances.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI saw an opportunity to make meaningful change, and that is when I became interested in coding.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy are you coding?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhatever the reason is, really think about it and pin it down. Use it as motivation to propel you towards your coding goals. Having this end goal will help you bust through plateaus and push through the hard parts (coding is hard).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery day that I spend at my current day job motivates me to get home, boot up my laptop, and continue my journey of learning how to code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe good news is that building coding skills is simple. All you have to do is code a lot. But unfortunately, this is where the hard part comes in. Fitting time into your busy life to routinely code is difficult, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to climb the coding mountain\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a gap between where you are now and where you want to be. That is why you are reading this article. That is why you work day in and out, and end up sacrificing time with your family and loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf we are spending all this time working towards our goal, it is paramount to make the most of the time we spend learning how to code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere are five steps to turn this dream into a reality:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCreate your personalized goals\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo make the most of your time, nothing is more important than making actionable short-term goals. This will not only help you feel a sense of accomplishment every time you meet a goal, but it will help make the coding journey feel a lot less daunting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoals Exercise!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help you come up with focused goals, I want to encourage you to do a quick exercise that I picked up from Laura Vanderkam.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Picture yourself one year from now. You have crushed ALL your coding goals and landed your dream job. You have given five talks at conferences around the world, and you built up your App and it was successful. Whatever success looks like to you, picture your future self. Please be ambitious, maybe even dream a little.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. What 3 - 5 goals did you accomplish in that year that made it so successful?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Write these goals down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Repeat this exercise for your personal life goals. It is impossible to work all the time, and to be successful you need work life balance (or you will burn out).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow you have 6 - 10 ambitious goals that you want to accomplish during the next year. To break these larger goals down into action items, think about and plan about how you can meet these goals.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor example, if you want to complete the freeCodeCamp front end certificate, you need to schedule time to work on it throughout the week. If you want to run a marathon, you need to buy running shoes, sign up for a marathon, and schedule time to train regularly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Make a Schedule\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll be honest - I am definitely not the scheduling type. I thought that I could wing it day by day. But realistically, you need to set time aside to focus, or your goals will pour over into the rest of your life. I found myself feeling anxious about coding during time with my family or when I was putting my kids to bed, because I hadn’t coded yet that day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe thing I looked forward to all day (coding) started to negatively impact my quality of life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSplitting your time into focused blocks allows you to be 100% in the present moment. When it is coding time, you can have tunnel vision and hack away. When it is time to unwind, or hang out with people you care about, you can be present because you coded that morning, or have time scheduled later in the day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI schedule a lot of family time. Family is really important to me. Your schedule will look a lot different, but the point is to create a schedule that will allow you to meet your goals without you hating life along the way. Just try to account for everything, so you can stick to your schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Audit yourself to find time opportunities\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWrite down all the activities in a given day or week and see what you really do with your time. You will likely be surprised by exactly how much time you spend mindlessly scrolling through your Instagram feed, or binge watching a new Netflix show (I love Stranger Things).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m not telling you to cut all of it out but keep a balance. You can definitely turn some of that idle time into some serious coding gains.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is more time than you think\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you are still thinking to yourself, “yeah, but I still work a lot and (insert excuse here) so I can’t find time”, then here is a fun fact! There are 168 hours in a week. If you work a full 40 hour week and subtract 8 hours of sleep per night (which I definitely don’t get) you still end up with 72 hours of “free” time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLook at all the time you have in your life situation and squeeze as much “good” stuff into that time as you can. There IS time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Fill your time with quality\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e Here are some tools that I use to help me accomplish my coding goals and stay focused on my learning path:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003efreeCodeCamp\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeriously one of the best tools for meeting goals. The curriculum is right there for you to follow and work on, it even tracks your progress!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eJavaScript 30\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e30 JavaScript projects really help you master array methods while filling up your portfolio with projects (plus it is tons of fun). Wes Bos is a solid instructor who provides a quality free course. You can complete it in 30 consecutive days, or work it into your learning schedule.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e100 Days of code on Twitter\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis 100 day challenge consists of coding every day and tweeting about what you did. It is a great tool for tracking progress and measuring how far you have come. This community is full of inspiring people from all over the world and is a great way to meet like minded developers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Web Developer Boot Camp\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI am almost finished with this course, and it has patched a lot of holes in my coding knowledge. Colt doesn’t just show you how to do something, he also explains why you do it a certain way. Plus, there is now an advanced web developer boot camp that I am going to take once I’m done.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLive It!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a resource, but you should embrace the tech community by living it. Listen to podcasts while you drive to work or do the dishes. Follow leaders in the industry on Twitter. Read articles. Immerse yourself in tech and you will learn without realizing you are learning.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Multiply your time\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe have set goals, and now have several larger goals broken down into actionable goals. We have gone through how to fit these goals into your busy life and I have helped give you some ideas on how to fill your time. Now, I want to tell you how you can make the most out of the time you put into coding.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Answer: Be Happy!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat does being happy have to do with managing time, you ask? Simply put: it is everything. The idea is called multiplying your time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBeing present and deeply focused leads to increased productivity. This in turn multiplies the time you spend by increasing efficiency. Plus, who doesn’t want to be happy?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAccording to Shawn Achor, who studied the effects of happiness and its link to productivity, your brain performs 31% more productively when you feel happy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDopamine, which floods into your system when you feel positive, does two things:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt makes you happier (duh!)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt turns on the learning centers in your brain. They help you learn things more easily, and allow you to spend less time on learning while retaining more information.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTurn your brain into a dopamine producing machine!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou can release more dopamine by creating lasting, positive change. There are five things you can work into your routine to turn your brain into a dopamine producing machine:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. Write three new things that you’re grateful for each day. This creates the habit of scanning the world for positive things, instead of negative ones.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. Journal about a positive experience you had in the last 24 hours. This allows you to relive the positive experience which leads to the same dopamine response.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Exercise. Go on a short walk before a coding session, or bust out a quick workout. Exercise releases tons of dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. Meditate. Meditation trains your brain to focus more on the task at hand, all while releasing dopamine.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. Random acts of kindness. Thank someone in your social support network for helping you, or help someone out. This not only releases dopamine for you, it also does the same for the person you helped (and they may pay it forward).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUse blocks of time to build your future\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEven if we are busy, we must take out time for the things that matter the most. When you focus on what matters, you can build the life you want with the blocks of time you have.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

I’ve spent thousands of hours reading books, writing code, and watching computer science lectures, all to prepare for the Google software engineer interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow I Got Here\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI started programming in middle school, but when it came time for college I pursued a degree in Economics. My rationale was that there would be too many programmers looking for jobs by the time I graduated. Boy, I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, I joined the Army to become a programmer, but the recruiter talked me into a military intelligence position, and I spent the next two years studying the Korean language. I served in South Korea for 2 years afterward.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore I left the Army, I attempted to get back into programming and was surprised at the difficulty. I had learned BASIC in middle school and kept programming it through high school. But I restarted my programming studies with C++, and the leap was too large. I just couldn’t grasp it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI did enjoy making websites, however, but I used software with a Word-like interface that I used to publish my websites. I didn’t know how to make websites from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter the Army, I decided to stay in Korea for a year and teach English. I used my nights and weekends to study web programming, using Perl, HTML, CSS (which was new at the time), JavaScript, and SQL.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter a year of intense study, I landed a job in the Seattle area, and I’ve been here ever since.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve been a web developer now for 15 years. I’ve started 3 companies, 2 of which are still running and generating revenue. I’ve worked at large and small companies, helped startups launch and grow, and recruited and managed teams. I’ve been a product manager, a CEO, a designer, and a marketer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve had a successful career and learned a lot along the way. But I’m not done yet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeeking a Career Change\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the part where I didn’t get a computer science degree? It has made a difference.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few years ago, I thought I could get hired anywhere. I thought I was hot stuff: the elusive full-stack web developer. But during my job search in 2013, I realized my skills were lacking. I had spent so much time chasing dollars by running startups in my spare time, that I had let my skills atrophy. I hadn’t kept up with technology.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor years, I had learned just enough to get by. I had a wide skill set but wasn’t an expert in anything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t get me wrong, I could still get hired, but not in the technologies or areas I wanted to work in. I could get hired for areas where the tech stack was somewhat outdated, like me. There’s big money in there, but I didn’t see exciting prospects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe realization reached its peak last year at a career fair. I was interested in perhaps working for one of the local companies that were startup labs run by venture capital firms. However, the fact that I lacked a computer science degree, and the skills and knowledge that accompany such a degree, meant I didn’t have a chance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was working full-time on my businesses at the time, and still am today.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 2016, I decided it was time to make a career change from web developer to software engineer. I would need to study hard and practice in order to compress a computer science degree into a few months, but once I did, I could start a new career.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou may not see web development and software engineering as different positions. Both involve programming and craftsmanship, but software engineering adds to it knowledge of data structures and algorithms, compiled languages, memory considerations, and understanding the impact of coding and architecture decisions on the machines where they reside.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLarge companies that hire for software engineering positions expect candidates to have this knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI reached out to an acquaintance who works at Google and asked him questions about his experience at the company. I had been reading How Google Works and was pretty familiar with Google already.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThrough another contact, I received a copy of Google’s coaching notes that are provided to interview candidates. This became the basis of my study plan.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle is a pretty awesome place to work, but before I even knew that, Google was my goal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy Google?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle sets a very high bar for hiring. They want to hire only the best. So if I set my sights high (getting hired at Google), I’ll still be quite hireable elsewhere even if I’m not selected.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe more I learn about Google, the more I want to work there.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn brief, Google is a company that hires smart, creative people, and treats them well. Google rewards merit, encourages big ideas, and gives employees the freedom to make good decisions for the user.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe hiring process is calibrated to bring in smart, passionate people. Google has honed the recruitment and interview process over the years. The brain teaser questions are long gone. Nowadays candidates are chosen based on coding ability, technical knowledge, and Googleyness. There’s a lot going on in that one word.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eManagement is different. Managers don’t micro-manage. They trust engineers to make the right decisions. Trusting employees changes the role of managers at Google from what most folks envision when they think of management. In addition, managers can’t unilaterally, hire, fire, or promote. Many of the important management decisions that could be perceived as office politics are handled by a committee to remove that danger.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle’s people operations (HR) has learned what works over time, and they use data and employee feedback to improve evaluation systems, the hiring process, promotions, compensation, benefits, and more. Read Work Rules! by Laszlo Bock (SVP, People Operations) for more.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes, the benefits are amazing. I went on a tour of the Google office in Kirkland, WA, and it surpassed my expectations. And my expectations were already high.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle Interview University\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the coaching notes I received telling me what to study? The list of topics seemed manageable, even though I didn’t know anything on the list.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI turned the topics on the notes into an outline and started filling in the topics with YouTube videos of lectures from MIT and UC Berkeley. A video on linked lists in one place, a video about queues in another. The list started to grow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI published the list on Github because my Github account was pretty empty. Since all the code I wrote for my businesses and work was private, my Github account made it look like I didn’t code at all. I needed to build up a portfolio. I originally called the project “Project 9894”. Google launched on Sept 4, 1998. Hence the name. I later renamed it to “Google Interview University”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver time I added some optional topics that I discovered along the way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was pretty amazed I had gotten so far in my career without even knowing how a CPU processed a program, how memory worked, or any of it. I had known “just enough” to be a success.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy little Github project started getting a few stars, and I published a blog post celebrating 20 stars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne morning, I awoke to find it had grown to 120 stars. Someone famous had tweeted about it during the night, and that led to it ending up on the Github daily trending report. I was #1 trending on Github for a few days.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany kind people reached out to thank and encourage me. It turns out there are thousands of people who want to not only work at Google but want to work as a software engineer, and this list was just the to-do list they needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt’s now at over 21,000 stars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI still can’t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat If I Don’t Get the Job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt won’t be the end of the world.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve put the time and dedication into my studies for the goal of getting hired as a Google software engineer, but even if I fail, I’ll still be armed with the skills and knowledge required to work as a software engineer at any company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWherever I end up, I’m going in as an entry-level software engineer. I’m not going in with 15 years of software engineering experience because I simply don’t have it. When it comes to this stuff, I’m the equivalent of a fresh CS grad.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I have the enthusiasm of a new grad, too. This is a new world for me. I’m just getting started. I’m not afraid to make mistakes. I know I will. I also want to learn everything I can and be an excellent addition to any team.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t Study As Much As I Did\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes, I took 8 months. But I could have abbreviated the process. Like any startup with a big goal, you make mistakes and do things that waste time. There are many things I wish I go back and do differently.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI studied topics I didn’t need to, some because I thought I would need them for the interview, and some because I wanted to have the knowledge on hand for when I started working. I didn’t want to be a burden on the team I’m assigned to. It turns out I simply over-prepared.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent 3 weeks reading a 1,000-page book on C++. I don’t remember 1,000 pages worth, but I know a good bit about C++ now. As it turns out, I’m using Python for the interview, not C++. I had assumed I needed C++, C, or Java, but I was wrong. It’s good to ask, not assume.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI read way more books than I needed to. There are only 3 or 4 books I should have read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI have a code catalog of dozens of algorithms that I review, most of which I wouldn’t expect in an interview. You don’t need to do that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI watched many hours of YouTube videos but could have watched far less, and spread out topics over time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI should have stopped reading books and watching videos earlier and started on coding problems sooner. I would have been able to spend more time applying the topics I learned.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpaced repetition is the key to memorization. Once you learn something, review it again later, and again even later. At each repetition, you reinforce your learning. Spending hours and hours at one time on priority queues won’t make you an expert. You become an expert by revisiting and reviewing over time. If you do so, you’ll get to the point where can’t forget details.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help review, I made 1,792 flashcards (digital flashcards). This is way too many. I review them on my phone or tablet whenever I get a spare moment (such as during Christmas shopping). Flash cards and spaced repetition go hand-in-hand. Once I get an answer on a flashcard right, I don’t mark it as known. I keep it in the deck and once I’ve seen it and answered it correctly many times, then I mark it as known.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy sense of fear (“What if they ask me a question about red-black trees?”) led me to study far more topics than I needed to.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I didn’t want to just prepare for the interview, I wanted to prepare for a career at Google, solving large-scale problems. That means knowing algorithms that will save computing resources of time, space, and I/O.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI may never need to know a maximum flow algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson), but it’s nice to know I have that tool available if the situation arises (without memorizing the implementation), and can recognize its application to a problem space.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConclusion\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEarly on, I wished I could skip all this learning, and just hurry up and get hired so I could instead spend my time learning the languages and tools for the team I join. But along the way, I realized how important this knowledge is, and even though most of it may not be applicable on a daily basis, I’m glad I put in the effort. I have a new appreciation of the history of computing, the greats in the field, data structures and algorithms (and how they complement each other), and how computer systems work at low-level.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll be putting in my application soon. It’s been a long journey getting to this point — almost an entire year. It began back in January, but I wasn’t able to commit to full-time study until April.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m about as prepared as I can be. I can’t keep studying and putting off the application forever. At some point, I have to take the leap.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI see a bright future ahead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst of all, thank you to everyone who cheered me on and supported me with your kind words over the last few months. I appreciate all of you so much. Your encouragement helped me get back to the whiteboard every day and practice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhy didn’t I get hired?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI don’t know why.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLast week I received a rejection email from the recruiter, and at first, I thought it was a mistake, and laughed it off. I checked in with my referral and he inquired into it and lobbied on my behalf, but in the end, it didn’t change the situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe thing that bothers me is that I didn’t even get a phone screen. I didn’t even talk to a recruiter over the phone. After all this work and enthusiasm, I didn’t even get a chance to prove myself.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ve done a lot of speculation about the reason why, but I won’t do that here. It’s all just guessing, which accomplishes nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I still like Google. However, I don’t know if I’ll apply again in the future. I want to get hired and stay at a company for a long time. I don’t want to hop around. The company that ends up hiring me will get a loyal, hardworking, enthusiastic employee. There are a lot of places where I can strive for greatness and have that effort rewarded.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRespect your Recruiter\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRecruiters look at hundreds of resumes every day, and they are highly tuned to detecting quality candidates and rejecting those who don’t match up with their model. For some reason, I just didn’t fit the profile. They probably are doing me a favor. It’s possible that I would have been in over my head and continually dragged my team down. Google is known for having false negatives in their selection process, but if you’re good enough for Google, you’ll eventually get in.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRecruiters know what works, and what doesn’t. So respect their decision and be polite. I’ll bet they deal with irate rejected candidates on a daily basis, so don’t be like that. Just get more experience and knowledge and try again later.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you may know, the last 11 months have been very difficult for me. As a self-taught web developer of 15 years, my computer science study plan took me months to get through, and the main motivator was to start a new career as a software engineer, tackling large problems at a large tech company.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGoogle was the company I had audaciously set my sights on, but in the end that turned into disappointment. If you haven’t read about my story, you’re missing out. Go ahead and read it first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, I reached out to my network, and made a lot of new friends. I got connected with every tech giant in the Pacific northwest. Of all of them, Amazon had always stood out — even more than Google — as the most innovative company over the last 10 years. I applied via a referral, whom I had met at a startup event in 2013, and got the process rolling.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter so many months of non-stop effort, sacrifice, and worry, I’m pleased to announce that I finally made it!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eToday I accepted an offer to be a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eIn this episode, Alex, a Romanian developer, tells the tale of how he and his friends grew their small side project into a $17,000 a month business. In the beginning, they were coding in a Starbucks. Now their team has grown, they've sponsored 20 hackathons around the world, and business is booming. Here's their story.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten by Alexandru Paduraru: \u003ca href= \"http://twitter.com/axelut\"\u003ehttp://twitter.com/axelut\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead by Quincy Larson: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/ossia\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/ossia\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2F5yfQX\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2F5yfQX\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript: \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn 2014, my friends and I set out to build the best possible web design tools. We built UI kits, Admin Dashboards, Templates, and Plugins. We’ve always tried to create products that are helpful in the development process, and that we ourselves would use for building websites for clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom a revenue’s perspective, if we don’t take into consideration the Black Friday sales (which doubled the amount that we made in November 2016), we are grossing around $22,000 per month. Part of that goes toward paying our affiliates’ commissions, collected VAT, payment vendors’ taxes, and other expenses. We end up netting around $17,000 each month.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn this case study, I’ll share exactly how we built our products and grew our business. You’ll hear all about:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat motivated us to start our startup, Creative Tim, and how we built our initial product\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow we got our first users\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMarketing strategies we used to grow\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow our business model works\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe story behind our revenue sources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBiggest lessons we’ve learned so far\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e1. What motivated us to get started with Creative Tim and how we built the initial product\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe started out as a two-person agency in Romania with no funding from third parties. We didn’t have enough cash to rent an office — even desks at a co-working space —so we just worked out of a Starbucks. We were barely able to pay our daily living expenses by doing work for clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCreative Tim was a side project that we thought would come in handy to web developers like ourselves. We noticed that we were always “reinventing the wheel” when working with clients, and creating the same items over and over again for their websites. So we wanted to create a few standard components, like login and register modals, calendars, wizards, headers, and footers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOver the span of a few months, we dedicated our time to implementing the platform and a few freebies (alongside the agency work). In the beginning, we didn’t have any Twitter followers, Facebook fans, or email list subscribers. We posted a lot of stuff about our freebies on various design forums and we used the “stalk web developers on Twitter” technique to spread the word about our products.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e2. How we got our first users\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt first, nobody really understood what we wanted to do. They didn’t understand the value we could provide by helping them improve their businesses. We decided that it would be better to create a more complex product that would help people understand what we were doing 🤔\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe launched the Get Shit Done Kit, a UI Kit based on Bootstrap. It was featured on Designer News, and it was quite popular. We got over 11,000 users from that source, which was a huge spike for our business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen two weeks later our startup was featured on Product Hunt. That gave us another spike with over 5,000 users. After that, the situation was stable, and we graduated from 0 users/week to a consistent 2,000 to 3,000 users/week.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA couple of months later, motivated by the success of free Get Shit Done Kit, we released Get Shit Done Kit PRO the premium version of GSDK, with more components and ready-to-use example pages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInitially, we only made a few sales. The product was generating about $200/week, which was not nearly enough to sustain our business. At the same time we were working on a web project for one of our clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen in December, we got published on Bootstrap Expo, the most popular gallery for showcasing websites created with Bootstrap. This was another important spike for our business. Since all of the people who go to Bootstrap Expo for inspiration already know Bootstrap or have previously worked with it, they were the perfect audience for our business.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLater, we discovered that getting traffic on your website is not enough to create a long term relationship with your users, and most of them forgot all about us after their first interaction. We did some research and discovered what most marketers probably already know: people forget things that they aren’t reminded of. Then we implemented the “Remember us email system” following the rules from the forgetting curve.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe wanted to give our users a reminder that we still existed and that we’re a valuable resource for their projects or their clients’ projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCurrently, we send emails at the following schedule:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter 3 days from their first download, we send an email with other recommended products.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 10 we send an email requesting feedback and asking if they need help.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 15 we remind them that they can upgrade to PRO.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn day 30 we ask them again for feedback and offer to promote something they’ve built in our gallery and social media.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe send a final reminder on day 60.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e3. Marketing strategies we used to grow\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost of our marketing strategies consisted of submitting our content to different communities like Reddit, Product Hunt, Designer News, Hacker News, and GitHub. Some important subreddits that work well in our area include /r/web_design, /r/html5, /r/frontend, and /r/webdev.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also paid between $100–200 for newsletter campaigns a couple of times. Even though the ROI ratio matched the amount we invested, the campaigns did not meet the expectations. (Maybe this was just in our case, that wasn’t profitable and it works better for others.)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen we paid $400 for Get Shit Done Kit PRO to appear in the Sidebar.io newsletter, a curated list of the 5 best design links made by Sacha Greif. This was a very rewarding newsletter for us, generating about $1,500 in sales.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen we purchased the “Review + Newsletter” package ($550) from eWebDesign. There were about 5,000 users who participated in the giveaway, and the total sales amounted $2,800.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe also thought about different places where we could find web developers who could use our products, and we realized that hackathons were exactly what we needed.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePresenting how our tools can help during the Hackathon\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSubsequently we started talking to people that were organizing hackathons to offer them free licenses for our “premium products.” We sponsored over 20 hackathons in different cities around the world (you can check them here).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the developers were happy to get free licenses, which made us happy that we could help them create better projects faster and they also found out who we are, so a win-win situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCritically, being physically present at some of the hackathons also gave us a lot of information about how the developers were using our products and how we could improve them in order to make them more user-friendly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn March 2015, we finished the agency’s contracts and we switched from “Agency mode” to “Startup mode.” With some revenue in the bank and a few monthly sales, our team moved to working full time for our startup. As we put everything together and constantly launched new products, our sources of traffic and revenue grew.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e4. How the business model works\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe realized that the best business model for Creative Tim was freemium: we create high quality freebies that help web developers build great websites, then release the PRO versions for those freebies, which contain more elements, sections, plugins, and example pages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this moment, we have 8 premium products, each of which have their own freebies. Their prices range from $19 to $599, depending on the license and archive type (HTML, HTML + PSD, HTML + Sketch). The freebies appear everywhere on different communities, blog posts, newsletters, and social websites — and they are driving all of our traffic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOur business model: create high quality freebies that help web developers build great websites, then release the PRO versions for those freebies which contain more elements. 👌🏼\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe basic idea is that those freebies are always appearing on top 10 lists in these big communities. Each post that’s in the top 10 (depending on how big is the community) gives us between 1,000 and 15,000 targeted users in one day. You can imagine how much that would cost if you wanted to do a regular targeted marketing campaign. 😮\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome examples:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePaper Kit — 380 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 560 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLight Bootstrap Dashboard Angular — 210 upvotes on Reddit\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 180 uvpotes on Hacker News (peak position 9 with over 14,000 users coming to our website in 1 day)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMaterial Kit — 860 upvotes on Product Hunt\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eetc… you got the idea\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e5. The story behind our revenue sources\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDirect Product Sales\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHere we have the regular sales that are done on our website, which are worth about 24% of our overall sales. This doesn’t include the Big Bundle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat is this Big Bundle, and how did we create it? We noticed that some of our users were downloading all our free products. (When I say all, I literally mean all of them in about 2–3 minutes after they have created an account.) We also noticed that some of our clients were purchasing all the products that were premium.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo we decided to test a new product called the “Big Bundle” which gives you access to all our products with huge discounts (over 60%). This big package was getting around 6–8 purchases per month. Since the prices for this Big Bundle is $299 (instead of $500) for the personal license and $669 (instead of $2,127) for the developer license, it’s a good source of revenue and a great deal for the web designers and agencies who are using our products for multiple clients. It’s a win-win situation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAffiliates Sales\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’ve created an affiliate network, and our affiliates are very happy because they get 50% to themselves from each transaction. For example, one of our most important affiliations is done through a very popular GitHub Repo: Bootstrap Material Design (17,000+ stars on GitHub). Currently, affiliates account for around 25% of our overall revenue.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOrganic Search (SEO)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe saw that we were also getting around 22% of our revenue from SEO. So we decided to invest more in SEO, we brought on an SEO consultant, whom we pay around $500/month to improve our products’ ranks in Google.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOther revenue\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe remainder of our monthly revenue comes from Facebook, Twitter, and our newsletter. Here’s how our revenue has evolved over time, along with some historically important moments, so you can understand why it has grown in some months:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e6. The biggest lessons we’ve learned so far\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt sounds cliché, but having a great product is crucial.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA lot of founders really struggle trying to market and sell something that people don’t want or don’t need. If your product is crap, there is no marketing strategy — and no source of investment — that can keep it alive for long.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the moment, our products are used by over 134,000 web developers around the world. We have people from Microsoft, Ubisoft, Vodafone, Orange, Harvard University, Stanford University, and governmental institutions downloading and using them as different internal tools, and we’ve sponsored more than 20 global hackathons from 14 countries.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t look to be the next Facebook. Try to solve a real problem instead.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEvery step in our development seemed like the natural thing to do at the time. Looking back at our evolution, we wouldn’t change anything. But with all we’ve learned, we could definitely do everything faster the second time around.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe’ve always created and improved our products based on our customers’ feedback, and that is the best way to develop a business. It doesn’t matter what you personally like — you need to make sure you solve a real problem for a real customer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRead, read, read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the past three years, I’ve read more than I’d read in my entire life, and this makes me feel great. Here are some of my favorite books, which I recommend to everybody:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow to Win Friends and Influence People — Dale Carnegie\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eZero to One — Peter Thiel\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Hard Thing About Hard Things — Ben Horowitz\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLaw of Success — Napoleon Hill\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThink and Grow Rich — Napoleon Hill\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGood to Great — Jim Collins\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Lean Startup — Eric Ries\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Charisma Myth — Olivia Fox Cabane\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster — Alistair Croll\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI really do think that the secret weapon is to deliver great products combined with a great user experience and a great customer support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe best decision that we made was to put our customer in the first row, and make sure that they were receiving a great UI kit/Dashboard that really solved their problems. That guided us through the whole journey. Our secret weapon is that we deliver great products combined with a great user experience and great customer support.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEverything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe are living in a world where anybody can become anything they want as long as they want to invest the amount of time that is needed. I’m saying time, and not money, because we all have time. I want to recommend two books that talk about this: Karaoke Capitalism by Jonas Ridderstråle and Kjell Nordstrom, and Zero to One by Peter Thiel (a PayPal co-founder).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this point, there are no limits. You can go anywhere on the planet and you can talk with whomever you want just by contacting them through social media. Today an ordinary person can achieve more influence than the president of a small country. Think of those Instagram accounts with millions of followers. If I — a regular guy from Romania — can build a profitable business in 2.5 years that is making 60x my country’s monthly minimum monthly wage, then boy, just about anything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e",

Today, I’m a 19 year old Android developer who has worked on over 50 apps and currently works for an MIT startup. My name is Elvis Chidera and this is my story.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy journey began with my curiosity about how to build a website. Growing up, I spent a lot of time online as I loved downloading games and reading Society Of Robots. I would save for weeks to buy a 10 MB internet bundle for 100 Naira ($0.28), and back in 2012, that could last for a month.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen learning to code, I took the first and simple step of doing a Google search about how to build a website. I got millions of results. Not knowing where to start, I clicked on the first link I saw, which was from W3CSchools.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe article explained that I need to learn some languages (HTML and CSS) to be able to build a website. I checked some other resources to confirm that I actually needed to learn these things. Then I started the W3CSchools HTML and CSS course.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEach day after school I would head over to the website to study. Initially, the code examples and explanations didn’t make much sense to me. But I kept studying regardless. I referred to various tutorials when I was stuck. This helped me view the problems I encountered from many different angles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I was younger, I struggled with my reading and writing skills in school. I was only able to get better at them through continuous practice. So I already had this model in my head: if I continue to practice — no matter how long it takes — I will ultimately be able to understand these programming languages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few months of intensive learning got me acquainted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I was still learning, a friend showed me the movie “The Social Network.” And after watching it, I was super motivated to build the next big thing. Thank you, Hollywood.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI had a eureka moment a few days later. The idea was to build a better version of Facebook. At that time, you couldn’t see your Facebook friends that were online. Also, Facebook was built to connect with people you already knew in real life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo that was my billion dollar startup idea: build a social network with all the features Facebook didn’t have. Mark Zuckerberg - I’m coming for you - or so I thought.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI spent the next few months building a better social network by adding any feature I could even think of using.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was naively confident that I was going to win.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter completing the project, I did what anybody without an advertising budget would do. I spammed the internet for days and days.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter several days of marketing, reality slapped me hard in the face. I only got 200 users, which I had to keep begging to come back to the site.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was depressed! A few months of hard work spent in vain. This taught me two important lessons the hard way:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI needed to recognize the cold start AKA chicken and egg problem that new platforms face early on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was building something I thought people needed. But I ended up building just another feature factory.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile it’s okay to be motivated by a project, you also need to know when you’re headed down a dead end. I spent a few more months trying to see if I could get more people on my site, but retention numbers kept dancing toward 0%, and I eventually gave up on the project.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I was motivated by the motto of Lewis in Meet the Robinsons, “Keep moving forward.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSeeking inspiration for my next project, I reflected on the needs of my local community. This time around, I wanted to build something that people actually needed and are willing to pay for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI came up with an idea to make text messages cheaper and easier to send to multiple people at a time. This was more like Whatsapp backed by SMS. After speaking to different people about it, I decided this was the next thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI named the project Xmx Me. It was going to be a J2ME app. This meant I had to learn Java. Looking back in time, I have to admit that it was the biggest challenge I’d yet encountered. I had to read some tutorials several times to fully understand them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter completing a few Java courses, I was ready for work. Relentlessly typing one line of code after another, I carefully built the backend with PHP, the frontend with HTML and CSS, and the mobile app with J2ME. The app was coming to life.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut here’s the thing — I didn’t own a laptop. I was building out all of these pieces of my app on my J2ME feature phone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWait. What?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYou read that right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI wrote my code on a Nokia 2690\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow I built my production apps on a feature phone\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt this point in my life, I had never actually programmed on a laptop. I simply couldn’t afford one. My parents wanted to help me. But it was difficult for them because they had to choose between paying my school fees (and other necessities) versus buying me a laptop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI hadn’t used a laptop before, and my only interaction with computers was at cyber cafes. I remember watching some videos about how to use a computer (left click, drag, drop, and other basic stuff) and then walking into a cyber cafe to practice them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was lucky that a relative had gifted me a feature phone (The Nokia 2690). This phone changed my life. It’s what I used to develop Xmx Me, my failed social network, and several other projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith nothing but a phone and the will to succeed, hour after hour I typed my code on that tiny keyboard. I was lucky again to have found an app that allowed me to compile my J2ME projects. Yes, building a J2ME app on a J2ME phone is possible.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe SDK was resource hungry, so my battery often died. I would carry on, writing out all my code on paper and try to review it for any syntax errors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI don’t think I’ll fail any Java whiteboard coding tests after having done this for so long. :)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLaunching my group SMS app\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter several months, I had the product ready. I was able to convince someone I met on an internet forum to help me pay for the website hosting and the bulk SMS service for a limited number of SMS units.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe app launch went well — at least better than my first project. We got some local press, and one of Kenya’s top blogs even wrote about the app. We grew organically to about 5,000 users.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe were in business. And we were getting transactions a couple of times a day.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWith no prior experience running a business, I made some huge mistakes, some of which were:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere was no easy way to charge users in Nigeria. Not everybody has a debit card. So I allowed people to pay using their mobile phone credit. The problem here was, there was no official way to convert this credit into money. I had to sell to vendors, who bought it back at a ridiculously low rates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere was little to no accounting. I was losing money and I didn’t know about it. I didn’t factor in some overhead costs. There were several missing pieces.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI was considering selling the App to buy a laptop. Not knowing what to do, I went online to beg. Yes, I was that shameless and hungry. It didn’t turn out well. Somebody accused of being a scammer, which I eventually resolved. Again, I was inexperienced and I handled the situation poorly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfter borrowing money multiple times to keep the business running, I decided to throw in the towel. Looking back, I think this was a bad decision. With a little more learning and experience, I would have been able to make things better. Maybe I didn’t see any future in an SMS app. Well, I released a throwback app recently, and many of the users still use it and love it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLessons I learned along the way\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI realized that if I was going to be able to afford a computer anytime soon, I would need to work hard for it. So I began saving all the money I could. I cut my daily expenses and lived as simple a life as possible. I asked my relatives for help. I even sold some personal belongings to raise money for the laptop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStill, it wasn’t enough. Determined to achieve my goal, I took on a freelance job of building a website so I could earn the remaining sum.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHow do you use a feature phone to build a website designed for PC users? Simple: have a Facebook friend who you disturb every night to view your website on his computer and give you feedback. It was cheaper than going to a cyber cafe repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also made heavy use of Ideone which allowed me to run my PHP scripts to see if they work before uploading them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, I finally was able to get that laptop. I can still remember the feeling of joy I had. That smell of plastic when you unbox a brand new cheap computer. I could now work on any project I wanted without feeling restricted because of my phone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince J2ME devices were slowly dying out, I eventually switched to building for the Android platform. My Java skills were still relevant there. I just needed to learn some platform-specific things.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe next year in 2015, after high school, I decided to start working to support my family. So I began freelancing. I was always active in local forums and groups, looking for people who wanted help with building an Android app.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause I didn’t have a good portfolio, I would build apps for some people before they even paid, without any guarantee that I’d be paid. I was stung by this approach several times, but it allowed me to build a good enough portfolio.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI would like to share something I wish I knew while I was freelancing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t spread yourself too thin. Taking up too many responsibilities is not good for your health, your family, or the clients.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI worked with several clients from different parts of Nigeria who loved my work. I eventually got a full-time job in Lagos, Nigeria after working with a client remotely.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen, while going through my news feed, I saw a job advert for an Android developer position at Dot Learn. I looked them up and realized they are an MIT startup working in an education technology field that I was passionate about, and in a market I understood. They had a unique idea: to solve the problem of access to online education by making educational videos that are extremely data-light — as low as 1MB for every hour of video.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis was almost unbelievable, and I knew it was key to making education very accessible to a lot of people.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI am very passionate about revolutionizing education in Africa. In fact, I have already built a free (ad-supported) exam prep app called PrepUp that has over 30,000+ installs and was one of the finalists at the West Africa Mobile Awards in 2016. So I wanted to be part of what Dot Learn was building.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo I went through the developer job requirements and I felt I had a chance. But impostor syndrome didn’t want me to be great.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor days I had conflicting thoughts. Should I apply or not?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThen I realized one thing: I had nothing to lose.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe worst that could happen would be that I got rejected. But I wouldn’t die. So, I went ahead and applied.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFingers crossed, I started re-watching several of the videos I had downloaded from MIT OCW. I also spent some nights watching some coding interview solution videos. In the past, I had mostly been hired based on my strong portfolio and previous job experience, but I didn’t want to be caught off guard if they gave me a coding interview.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWell, long story short: after lots of preparation, answering some difficult questions, a phone interview, and some coding projects, I was accepted.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe it. I was ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLooking back at it, this was one of my best decisions.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWorking at Dotlearn, I have had exponential growth in my career and have met with lots of awesome people from MIT, Harvard, and other great places.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrom attending big events like the Techcrunch Battlefield (I ended up missing my flight) to realizing I could rap, it’s been a fun and exciting experience so far.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "\u003cp\u003eAn Australian developer thought his local police force was spending way too much money on their new license plate scanning system. So he decided to build one himself. Here's how he did this, and how he ended up catching a criminal.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWritten and read by Tait Brown: \u003ca href= \"https://twitter.com/taitems\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/taitems\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOriginal article: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2iJWWuE\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2iJWWuE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLearn to code for free at: \u003ca href= \"https://www.freecodecamp.org\"\u003ehttps://www.freecodecamp.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIntro music by Vangough: \u003ca href= \"https://fcc.im/2APOG02\"\u003ehttps://fcc.im/2APOG02\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTranscript:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Victoria Police are the primary law enforcement agency of Victoria, Australia. With over 16,000 vehicles stolen in Victoria this past year — at a cost of about $170 million — the police department is experimenting with a variety of technology-driven solutions to crackdown on car theft. They call this system BlueNet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo help prevent fraudulent sales of stolen vehicles, there is already a VicRoads web-based service for checking the status of vehicle registrations. The department has also invested in a stationary license plate scanner — a fixed tripod camera which scans passing traffic to automatically identify stolen vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon’t ask me why, but one afternoon I had the desire to prototype a vehicle-mounted license plate scanner that would automatically notify you if a vehicle had been stolen or was unregistered. Understanding that these individual components existed, I wondered how difficult it would be to wire them together.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut it was after a bit of googling that I discovered the Victoria Police had recently undergone a trial of a similar device, and the estimated cost of roll out was somewhere in the vicinity of $86,000,000. One astute commenter pointed out that the $86M cost to fit out 220 vehicles comes in at a rather thirsty $390,909 per vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSurely we can do a bit better than that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Success Criteria\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore getting started, I outlined a few key requirements for product design.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #1: The image processing must be performed locally\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eStreaming live video to a central processing warehouse seemed the least efficient approach to solving this problem. Besides the whopping bill for data traffic, you’re also introducing network latency into a process which may already be quite slow.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough a centralized machine learning algorithm is only going to get more accurate over time, I wanted to learn if an local on-device implementation would be “good enough”.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #2: It must work with low quality images\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince I don’t have a Raspberry Pi camera or USB webcam, so I’ll be using dashcam footage — it’s readily available and an ideal source of sample data. As an added bonus, dashcam video represents the overall quality of footage you’d expect from vehicle mounted cameras.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRequirement #3: It needs to be built using open source technology\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRelying upon a proprietary software means you’ll get stung every time you request a change or enhancement — and the stinging will continue for every request made thereafter. Using open source technology is a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy solution\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt a high level, my solution takes an image from a dashcam video, pumps it through an open source license plate recognition system installed locally on the device, queries the registration check service, and then returns the results for display.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe data returned to the device installed in the law enforcement vehicle includes the vehicle’s make and model (which it only uses to verify whether the plates have been stolen), the registration status, and any notifications of the vehicle being reported stolen.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf that sounds rather simple, it’s because it really is. For example, the image processing can all be handled by the openalpr library.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis is really all that’s involved to recognize the characters on a license plate:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Minor Caveat\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePublic access to the VicRoads APIs is not available, so license plate checks occur via web scraping for this prototype. While generally frowned upon — this is a proof of concept and I’m not slamming anyone’s servers.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eResults\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI must say I was pleasantly surprised.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI expected the open source license plate recognition to be pretty rubbish. Additionally, the image recognition algorithms are probably not optimised for Australian license plates.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe solution was able to recognise license plates in a wide field of view.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAnnotations added for effect. Number plate identified despite reflections and lens distortion.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough, the solution would occasionally have issues with particular letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few frames later, the M is correctly identified and at a higher confidence rating.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs you can see in the above two images, processing the image a couple of frames later jumped from a confidence rating of 87% to a hair over 91%.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m confident, pardon the pun, that the accuracy could be improved by increasing the sample rate, and then sorting by the highest confidence rating. Alternatively a threshold could be set that only accepts a confidence of greater than 90% before going on to validate the registration number.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThose are very straight forward code-first fixes, and don’t preclude the training of the license plate recognition software with a local data set.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe $86,000,000 Question\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo be fair, I have absolutely no clue what the $86M figure includes — nor can I speak to the accuracy of my open source tool with no localized training vs. the pilot BlueNet system.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI would expect part of that budget includes the replacement of several legacy databases and software applications to support the high frequency, low latency querying of license plates several times per second, per vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the cost of ~$391k per vehicle seems pretty rich — especially if the BlueNet isn’t particularly accurate and there are no large scale IT projects to decommission or upgrade dependent systems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFuture Applications\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhile it’s easy to get caught up in the Orwellian nature of an “always on” network of license plate snitchers, there are many positive applications of this technology. Imagine a passive system scanning fellow motorists for an abductors car that automatically alerts authorities and family members to their current location and direction.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTeslas vehicles are already brimming with cameras and sensors with the ability to receive OTA updates — imagine turning these into a fleet of virtual good samaritans. Ubers and Lyft drivers could also be outfitted with these devices to dramatically increase the coverage area.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUsing open source technology and existing components, it seems possible to offer a solution that provides a much higher rate of return — for an investment much less than $86M.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRemember the $86 million license plate scanner I replicated? I caught someone with it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA few weeks ago, I published what I thought at the time was a fairly innocuous article: How I replicated an $86 million project in 57 lines of code.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’ll admit — it was a rather click-bait claim. I was essentially saying that I’d reproduced the same license plate scanning and validating technology that the police in Victoria, Australia had just paid $86 million for.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince then, the reactions have been overwhelming. My article received over 100,000 hits in the first day, and at last glance sits somewhere around 450,000. I’ve been invited to speak on local radio talk shows and at a conference in California. I think someone may have misread Victoria, AU as Victoria, BC.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlthough I politely declined these offers, I have met for coffee with various local developers and big name firms alike. It’s been incredibly exciting.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost readers saw it for what it was: a proof of concept to spark discussion about the use of open source technology, government spending, and one man’s desire to build cool stuff from his couch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePedants have pointed out the lack of training, support, and usual enterprise IT cost padders, but it’s not worth anyone’s time exploring these. I’d rather spend this post looking at my results and how others can go about shoring up their own accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBefore we get too deep into the results, I’d like to go over one thing that I feel was lost in the original post. The concept for this project started completely separate from the $86 million BlueNet project. It was by no means an attempt to knock it off.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt started with the nagging thought that since OpenCV exists and the VicRoads website has license plate checks, there must be a way to combine the two or use something better.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt was only when I began my write-up that I stumbled upon BlueNet. While discovering BlueNet and its price tag gave me a great editorial angle, with the code already written. There were bound to be some inconsistencies between the projects.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also believe part of the reason this blew up was the convenient timing of a report on wasteful government IT spending in Australia. The Federal Government’s IT bill has shot up from $5.9 billion to $10 billion, and it delivered dubious value for that blow out. Media researchers who contacted me were quick to link the two, but this is not something I am quick to encourage.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Disclaimer\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the spirit of transparency, I must declare something that was also missing from the original post. My previous employer delivered smaller (less than $1 million) IT projects for Victoria Police and other state bodies. As a result, I’ve undergone police checks and completed the forms required to become a VicPol contractor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis may imply I have an axe to grind or have some specific insider knowledge, but instead I am proud of the projects we delivered. They were both on time and on budget.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVisualizing the Results\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe following is a video representation of my results, composited in After Effects for a bit of fun. I recorded various test footage, and this was the most successful clip.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI will go into detail about ideal camera setups, detection regions, and more after the video. It will help you better understand what made this iPhone video I took from through the windscreen a better video than a Contour HD angled out the side window.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn Ethical Dilemma\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf you saw the hero graphic of this article or watched the video above, you may have noticed a very interesting development: I caught someone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpecifically, I caught someone driving a vehicle with a canceled registration from 2016. This could have happened for many reasons, the most innocent of which is a dodgy resale practice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOccasionally, when the private sale of a vehicle is not done by the book, the buyer and seller may not complete an official transfer of registration. This saves the buyer hundreds of dollars, but the vehicle is still registered to the seller. It’s not unheard of for a seller to then cancel the registration and receive an ad hoc refund of remaining months, also worth hundreds of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAlternatively, the driver of the vehicle could well be the criminal we suspect that they are.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo, although I jokingly named the project plate-snitch when I set it up on my computer, I’m now faced with the conundrum of whether to report what I saw.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUltimately, the driver was detected using a prototype of a police-only device. But driving on a 2016 registration (canceled, not expired) is a very deliberate move. Hmm.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBack to the Results\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf the many reactions to my article, a significant amount were quite literal and dubious. Since I said I replicated the software, they asserted that I must have a support center, warranties, and training manuals. One even attempted to replicate my results and hit the inevitable roadblocks of image quality and source material.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBecause of this, some implied that I cherry-picked my source images. To that I can only say, “Well, duh.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen I built my initial proof of concept (again, focusing on validating an idea, not replicating BlueNet), I used a small sample set of less than ten images. Since camera setup is one of, if not the most, important factors in ALPR, I selected them for ideal characteristics that enhance recognition.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, it is very simple to take a fragile proof of concept and break it. The true innovation and challenge comes from taking a proof of concept, and making it work. Throughout my professional career, many senior developers have told me that things can’t be done or at least can’t be done in a timely manner. Sometimes they were right. Often, they were just risk averse.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“Nothing is impossible until it is proven to be.”\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany people bastardize this quote, and you may have seen or heard one of it’s incarnations before. To me, it neatly summarizes a healthy development mindset, in which spiking and validating ideas is almost mandatory to understanding them.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptimal ALPR Camera Setups\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis project is so exciting and different for me because it has a clear success metric — whether the software recognizes the plate. This can only happen with a combination of hardware, software, and networking solutions. After posting my original article, people who sell ALPR cameras quickly offered advice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOptical Zoom\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe most obvious solution in hindsight is the use of an optical zoom. Though I explore other important factors below, none lead to such a sheer increase in recognition as this. In general, professional ALPR solutions are offset at an angle, trained on where the license plate will be, and zoomed into the area to maximize clarity.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis means the more zoom, more pixels to play with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAll the cameras I had at my disposal were of a fixed lens. They included:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Contour HD action camera. These came out in 2009, and I use mine to record my cycling commute and to replay each week’s near death experience.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe featured test run was recorded on my phone. My only method of replicating an optical zoom was using an app to record at 3K instead of 1080p, and then digitally zooming and cropping. Again, more pixels to play with.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAngle \u0026 Positioning\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe viewing angle of 30° is often referenced as the standard for ideal plate recognition. This is incredibly important when you learn that BlueNet uses an array of cameras. It also makes sense when you consider what a front facing camera would generally see — not very much.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat a front facing ALPR camera sees — not much.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf I had to guess I’d say a mostly forward-facing array would be the ideal setup. It would consist of a single camera pointed dead center as above, two off-center at 30° each side, and a single rear-facing camera. The value in having most of the cameras pointed forward would come from the increased reaction time if the vehicle is traveling in the opposite direction. This would allow a quicker scan, process, and U-turn than if the rear facing cameras picked up a suspect vehicle already ten meters past the police vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA four camera array would need to be angled similar to this. Icons from Freepik.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA Gymbal\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhen compositing the video, I thought about stabilizing the footage. Instead I opted to show the bumpy ride for what it was. What you saw was me holding my phone near the windscreen while my wife drove. Check out that rigorous scientific method.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAny production-ready version of a vehicle-mounted ALPR needs some form of stabilisation. Not a hand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrame Rate\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBoth the attempt to replicate my project and my recordings since then explored the same misconception that ALPR sampling frame rate may be linked to success. In my experience, this did nothing but waste cycles. Instead, what is incredibly important is the shutter speed creating clean, crisp footage that feeds well into the algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut I was also testing fairly low-speed footage. At most, two vehicles passing each other in a 60km/h zone created a 120km/h differential. BlueNet, on the other hand, can work up to an alleged 200km/h.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs a way of solving this, a colleague suggested object detection and out-of-band processing. Identify a vehicle and draw a bounding box. Wait for it to come into the ideal recognition angle and zoom. Then shoot a burst of photos for asynchronous processing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI looked into using OpenCV (node-opencv) for object recognition, but I found something simpler like face detection, taking anywhere from 600–800ms. Not only less than ideal for my use, but pretty poor in general.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHype-train TensorFlow comes to the rescue. Able to run on-device, there are examples of projects identifying multiple vehicles per frame at an astounding 27.7fps. This version could even expose speed estimations. Legally worthless, but perhaps useful in every day policing (no fps benchmark in readme).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo better explain how high-performance vehicle recognition could couple with slower ALPR techniques, I created another video in After Effects. I imagine that the two working hand-in-hand would look something like this:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIdea: how vehicle object detection could remove ALPR frame limits by processing asynchronously.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrame Rate vs Shutter Speed\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA different manifestation of frame rate is largely influenced upon shutter speed, and more specifically, the rolling shutter issues that plague early or low end digital movie recorders. The following is a snapshot from some Contour HD footage. You can see at only 60km/h the rolling shutter issue makes the footage more or less unusable from an ALPR point of view.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdjusting frame rate on both the Contour HD and my iPhone did not result in noticeably less distortion. In theory, a higher shutter speed should produce clearer and crisper images. They’d become increasingly important if you were to chase the 200km/h BlueNet benchmark. Less blur and less rolling shutter distortion would ideally lead to a better read.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOpen ALPR Version\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne of the more interesting discoveries was that the node-openalpr version I was using is both out-of-date and not nearly as powerful as their proprietary solution. While an open source requirement was certainly a factor, it was amazing how accurately the cloud version could successfully read frames that I couldn’t even identify a plate on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eALPR Country Training Data\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI also found that the main node-openalpr package defaults to US country processing with no way of overriding it. You have to pull down someone else’s fork which allows you to then provide an extra country parameter.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSlimline Australian plates need their own separate country detection to regular Australian plates?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut this doesn’t always help. Using the default US algorithm I was able to produce the most results. Specifying the Australian data set actually halved the number of successful plate reads, and it only managed to find one or two that the US algorithm couldn’t. Providing the separate “Australian Wide Plate” set again halved the count and introduced a single extra plate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is clearly a lot to be desired when it comes to Australian-based data sets for ALPR, and I think that the sheer number of plate styles available in Victoria is a contributing factor.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGood luck with that.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlanar Warps\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOpen ALPR comes with one particular tool to reduce the impact of distortion from both the camera angle and rolling shutter issues. Planar warp refers to a method in which coordinates are passed to the library to skew, translate, and rotate an image until it closely resembles a straight-on plate.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn my limited testing experience, I wasn’t able to find a planar warp that worked at all speeds. When you consider rolling shutter, it makes sense that the distortion grows relative to vehicle speed. I would imagine feeding accelerometer or GPS speed data as a coefficient might work. Or, you know, get a camera that isn’t completely rubbish.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWhat others are doing in the industry\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNumerous readers reached out after the last post to share their own experiences and ideas. Perhaps one of the more interesting solutions shared with me was by Auror in New Zealand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey employ fixed ALPR cameras in petrol stations to report on people stealing petrol. This in itself is not particularly new and revolutionary. But when coupled with their network, they can automatically raise an alert when known offenders have returned, or are targeting petrol stations in the area.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIndependent developers in Israel, South Africa, and Argentina have shown interest in building their own hacked-together versions of BlueNet. Some will probably fare better than others, as places like Israel use a seven digit license plates with no alphabet characters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKey Takeaways\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is simply too much that I’ve learned in the last few weeks of dabbling to fit into one post. While there have been plenty of detractors, I really do appreciate the support and knowledge that has been sent my way.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of challenges you will face in trying to build your own ALPR solution, but thankfully a lot of them are solved problems.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTo put things in perspective, I’m a designer and front end developer. I’ve spent about ten hours now on footage and code, another eight on video production, and at least another ten on write-ups alone. I’ve achieved what I have by standing on the shoulders of giants. I’m installing libraries built by intelligent people and have leveraged advice from people who sell these cameras for a living.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe $86 million question still remains — if you can build a half-arsed solution that does an okay job by standing on the shoulders of giants, how much more money should you pour in to do a really really good job?\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy solution is not even in the same solar system as the 99.999% accurate scanner that some internet commenters seem to expect. But then again, BlueNet only has to meet a 95% accuracy target.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo if $1 million gets you to 80% accuracy, and maybe $10 million gets you to 90% accuracy — when do you stop spending? Furthermore, considering that the technology has proven commercial applications here in Oceania, how much more taxpayer money should be poured into a proprietary, close-sourced solution when local startups could benefit? Australia is supposed to be an “innovation nation” after all.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "description": "Was 2017 really the \"worst year ever,\" as some would have us believe? In his analysis of recent data on homicide, war, poverty, pollution and more, psychologist Steven Pinker finds that we're doing better now in every one of them when compared with 30 years ago. But progress isn't inevitable, and it doesn't mean everything gets better for everyone all the time, Pinker says. Instead, progress is problem-solving, and we should look at things like climate change and nuclear war as problems to be solved, not apocalypses in waiting. \"We will never have a perfect world, and it would be dangerous to seek one,\" he says. \"But there's no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.\"\u003cimg src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/2HeG6GbpVUk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/\u003e",

Series three of Sound Matters kicks off an eight-part international journey – The Sound Of The Cities – starting at home in Copenhagen, Denmark. Host and writer Tim Hinman discovers the world’s (possibly) oldest home sound system in the Renaissance-era Rosenborg Castle, and then artist Katinka Fogh Vindelev guides Tim through the echo-chamber-like Round Tower, surprising a swath of tourists when she sings a song for the building itself.

It’s never gotten in the way of the music that moves you. Well, actually, there are audiophiles out there obsessed with realistic, high fidelity sound reproduction, and they think otherwise. Wax cylinder, vinyl, 8-track tape, CD, minidisc and more: our love for music is unshakeable, but that’s not the case with the numerous formats we use to store our recordings. In a year that marked the end of the MP3 alongside the continuing resurgence of actual, real life records, Sound Matters’ Tim Hinman cuts through a jungle of cables, spools of tape, and mountains of scratched CDs in search of the mythical perfect audio experience.\nhttp://www.beoplay.com/soundmatters",

Well, sometimes people get all mixed up. Specifically, their senses are mixed. It’s called synesthesia – a perceptual phenomenon in us humans where we experience one sensory stimulation with or through a secondary sense – letters, numbers or sounds have specific colours to them, words have specific textures, and so on. One in 23 of us understand the world in this way, to varying degrees. In this ultimate episode of the second series of Sound Matters, our unflagging host Tim Hinman straps on his sensorial spelunking kit and goes looking (and listening) for the mystery of synesthesia. Happily, he also travels to Jamaica with Professor Julian Henriques of Goldsmiths College, University of London, and talks sound systems, feeling the bass, and the important difference between mere science and SCIAANCE. Come with us in this last episode of the second series of Sound Matters. Relax and set your senses free.\n\nBrought to you by Bang \u0026 Olufsen.",

    "description": "How is it possible that listening to music can make your legs, heart and lungs work better? Our podcast series Sound Matters returns for another eight episodes through 2017. In this brand spanking new episode, our intrepid sound guide Tim Hinman gets his jogging kit on and hits the treadmill on a quest to get motivated and find the hidden wiring between music and sport – travelling to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and chatting with Olympiads including long jumper Tyrone Smith, high jumper David Adley Smith, and racing cyclist silver medalist Chloé Dygert, as well as Dr Costas Karageorghis, a world-leading researcher on music for competitive performance at Brunel University in London, UK.\n\nhttp://www.beoplay.com/soundmatters\n@beoplay\n#beoplay #soundmatters",

The question might sound like a riddle or the start of some joke but for composer and sound designer Yann Coppier snow and ice are rich materials for making sounds and art. In this episode of our Sound Matters podcast series, host Tim Hinman focuses his ears on the specialist field of sound art – meeting and speaking with Coppier about his time recording in Greenland and how he makes those sounds part of his art, and Jacob Kirkegaard whose interest in the sounds of Chernobyl, the inner ear and Ethiopia informs his own artistic practice.\n\nhttp://studio-ovale.com\nhttp://fonik.dk",

    "description": "How can you tell the difference between a good sound and a bad sound? There’s not much that’s more annoying than to be forced to listen to a bad sound – but what do we mean when we call something a bad sound, and is that bad sound heard and understood in the same way by different people? In this final episode of our podcast series, host Tim Hinman argues that it’s all relative –good sound and bad sound. But relative to exactly what? That’s the hard part. Featuring Mark Grimshaw, Professor of Music at Aalborg University and Andreas Hudelmayer, a luthier working out of Clerkenwell, London.",

We take hearing for granted unless, of course, you were born deaf and never heard anything – just like Jo Milne, our guest in this episode of Sound Matters. Milne was deaf until she was forty years old when she had cochlear implants, an experience that was recorded and uploaded to YouTube. Tim Hinman visits Milne a year after she first heard the world, as well as visiting a reverb chamber and an anechoic room with Finn Agerkvist of the Danish Technical University to find out what hearing nothing might sound like.",

A car passing by, maybe an airplane flying overhead, a few birds chirping away in a tree in front of your house, a couple of dogs play fighting in next door’s garden? Tim Hinman presents a lazy man’s guide to exploring the sounds of the natural world – specifically noises of the animal kind. Tim speaks with radio producer Colette Kinsella, who lives right in the middle of Dublin Zoo and records the nocturnal sounds of the animals after all us humans have gone to bed, and Greg Budney, Curator for Collections, Development and Outreach at the McCauly Library a project at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Cornell University – the largest archive for biodiversity audio and video recordings in the world.",

    "description": "There’s a problem with your brain… well, not your brain specifically, but there’s a problem when it comes to neuroscientists understanding how your brain works when you’re listening to stuff. In the past few years there have been massive advancements in mapping out the parts of your brain that are activated when when you hear. But the closer we look, the more complicated it gets. What exactly, in all that insanely complex network of neural connections, is going on in your head that makes it possible to hear sounds, filter out only the most important parts, and understand what they mean? In our fourth instalment, intrepid host Tim Hinman meets Trevor Cox, a professor of acoustics and perception, and gets the lowdown on what’s up with the brain and how (we think) it cognates sound.",
