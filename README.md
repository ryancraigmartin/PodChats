# PodChats

## Developed in one week at IronHack Miami - May 2018

PodChats is the first CRUD application I built during my time as a student in Ironhack's Full Stack Web Development cohort in the Spring of 2018. This app allows for users to sign up for an account and post reviews based on podcast episodes that they have listened to and can read what others are saying about the episode.
